the
sonnets
by
william
shakespeare
from
fairest
creatures
we
desire
increase
that
thereby
beauty
rose
might
never
die
but
as
the
riper
should
by
time
decease
his
tender
heir
might
bear
his
memory
but
thou
contracted
to
thine
own
bright
eyes
feed
thy
light
flame
with
self-substantial
fuel
making
famine
where
abundance
lies
thy
self
thy
foe
to
thy
sweet
self
too
cruel
thou
that
art
now
the
world
fresh
ornament
and
only
herald
to
the
gaudy
spring
within
thine
own
bud
buriest
thy
content
and
tender
churl
mak
waste
in
niggarding
pity
the
world
or
else
this
glutton
be
to
eat
the
world
due
by
the
grave
and
thee
when
forty
winters
shall
besiege
thy
brow
and
dig
deep
trenches
in
thy
beauty
field
thy
youth
proud
livery
so
gazed
on
now
will
be
tattered
weed
of
small
worth
held
then
being
asked
where
all
thy
beauty
lies
where
all
the
treasure
of
thy
lusty
days
to
say
within
thine
own
deep
sunken
eyes
were
an
all-eating
shame
and
thriftless
praise
how
much
more
praise
deserved
thy
beauty
use
if
thou
couldst
answer
this
fair
child
of
mine
shall
sum
my
count
and
make
my
old
excuse
proving
his
beauty
by
succession
thine
this
were
to
be
new
made
when
thou
art
old
and
see
thy
blood
warm
when
thou
feel
it
cold
look
in
thy
glass
and
tell
the
face
thou
viewest
now
is
the
time
that
face
should
form
another
whose
fresh
repair
if
now
thou
not
renewest
thou
dost
beguile
the
world
unbless
some
mother
for
where
is
she
so
fair
whose
uneared
womb
disdains
the
tillage
of
thy
husbandry
or
who
is
he
so
fond
will
be
the
tomb
of
his
self-love
to
stop
posterity
thou
art
thy
mother
glass
and
she
in
thee
calls
back
the
lovely
april
of
her
prime
so
thou
through
windows
of
thine
age
shalt
see
despite
of
wrinkles
this
thy
golden
time
but
if
thou
live
remembered
not
to
be
die
single
and
thine
image
dies
with
thee
unthrifty
loveliness
why
dost
thou
spend
upon
thy
self
thy
beauty
legacy
nature
bequest
gives
nothing
but
doth
lend
and
being
frank
she
lends
to
those
are
free
then
beauteous
niggard
why
dost
thou
abuse
the
bounteous
largess
given
thee
to
give
profitless
usurer
why
dost
thou
use
so
great
sum
of
sums
yet
canst
not
live
for
having
traffic
with
thy
self
alone
thou
of
thy
self
thy
sweet
self
dost
deceive
then
how
when
nature
calls
thee
to
be
gone
what
acceptable
audit
canst
thou
leave
thy
unused
beauty
must
be
tombed
with
thee
which
used
lives
th
executor
to
be
those
hours
that
with
gentle
work
did
frame
the
lovely
gaze
where
every
eye
doth
dwell
will
play
the
tyrants
to
the
very
same
and
that
unfair
which
fairly
doth
excel
for
never-resting
time
leads
summer
on
to
hideous
winter
and
confounds
him
there
sap
checked
with
frost
and
lusty
leaves
quite
gone
beauty
er-snowed
and
bareness
every
where
then
were
not
summer
distillation
left
liquid
prisoner
pent
in
walls
of
glass
beauty
effect
with
beauty
were
bereft
nor
it
nor
no
remembrance
what
it
was
but
flowers
distilled
though
they
with
winter
meet
leese
but
their
show
their
substance
still
lives
sweet
then
let
not
winter
ragged
hand
deface
in
thee
thy
summer
ere
thou
be
distilled
make
sweet
some
vial
treasure
thou
some
place
with
beauty
treasure
ere
it
be
self-killed
that
use
is
not
forbidden
usury
which
happies
those
that
pay
the
willing
loan
that

thy

to
breed
another
thee
or
ten
times
happier
be
it
ten
for
one
ten
times
thy
self
were
happier
than
thou
art
if
ten
of
thine
ten
times
refigured
thee
then
what
could
death
do
if
thou
shouldst
depart
leaving
thee
living
in
posterity
be
not
self-willed
for
thou
art
much
too
fair
to
be
death
conquest
and
make
worms
thine
heir
lo
in
the
orient
when
the
gracious
light
lifts
up
his
burning
head
each
under
eye
doth
homage
to
his
new-appearing
sight
serving
with
looks
his
sacred
majesty
and
having
climbed
the
steep-up
heavenly
hill
resembling
strong
youth
in
his
middle
age
yet
mortal
looks
adore
his
beauty
still
attending
on
his
golden
pilgrimage
but
when
from
highmost
pitch
with
weary
car
like
feeble
age
he
reeleth
from
the
day
the
eyes
fore
duteous
now
converted
are
from
his
low
tract
and
look
another
way
so
thou
thy
self
out-going
in
thy
noon
unlooked
on
diest
unless
thou
get
son
music
to
hear
why
hear
thou
music
sadly
sweets
with
sweets
war
not
joy
delights
in
joy
why
lov
thou
that
which
thou
receiv
not
gladly
or
else
receiv
with
pleasure
thine
annoy
if
the
true
concord
of
well-tuned
sounds
by
unions
married
do
offend
thine
ear
they
do
but
sweetly
chide
thee
who
confounds
in
singleness
the
parts
that
thou
shouldst
bear
mark
how
one
string
sweet
husband
to
another
strikes
each
in
each
by
mutual
ordering
resembling
sire
and
child
and
happy
mother
who
all
in
one
one
pleasing
note
do
sing
whose
speechless
song
being
many
seeming
one
sings
this
to
thee
thou
single
wilt
prove
none
is
it
for
fear
to
wet
widow
eye
that
thou
consum
thy
self
in
single
life
ah
if
thou
issueless
shalt
hap
to
die
the
world
will
wail
thee
like
makeless
wife
the
world
will
be
thy
widow
and
still
weep
that
thou
no
form
of
thee
hast
left
behind
when
every
private
widow
well
may
keep
by
children
eyes
her
husband
shape
in
mind
look
what
an
unthrift
in
the
world
doth
spend
shifts
but
his
place
for
still
the
world
enjoys
it
but
beauty
waste
hath
in
the
world
an
end
and
kept
unused
the
user
so
destroys
it
no
love
toward
others
in
that
bosom
sits
that
on
himself
such
murd
rous
shame
commits
for
shame
deny
that
thou
bear
love
to
any
who
for
thy
self
art
so
unprovident
grant
if
thou
wilt
thou
art
beloved
of
many
but
that
thou
none
lov
is
most
evident
for
thou
art
so
possessed
with
murd
rous
hate
that
gainst
thy
self
thou
stick
not
to
conspire
seeking
that
beauteous
roof
to
ruinate
which
to
repair
should
be
thy
chief
desire
change
thy
thought
that
may
change
my
mind
shall
hate
be
fairer
lodged
than
gentle
love
be
as
thy
presence
is
gracious
and
kind
or
to
thy
self
at
least
kind-hearted
prove
make
thee
another
self
for
love
of
me
that
beauty
still
may
live
in
thine
or
thee
as
fast
as
thou
shalt
wane
so
fast
thou
grow
in
one
of
thine
from
that
which
thou
departest
and
that
fresh
blood
which
youngly
thou
bestow
thou
mayst
call
thine
when
thou
from
youth
convertest
herein
lives
wisdom
beauty
and
increase
without
this
folly
age
and
cold
decay
if
all
were
minded
so
the
times
should
cease
and
threescore
year
would
make
the
world
away
let
those
whom
nature
hath
not
made
for
store
harsh
featureless
and
rude
barrenly
perish
look
whom
she
best
endowed
she
gave
thee
more
which
bounteous
gift
thou
shouldst
in
bounty
cherish
she
carved
thee
for
her
seal
and
meant
thereby
thou
shouldst
print
more
not
let
that
copy
die
when
do
count
the
clock
that
tells
the
time
and
see
the
brave
day
sunk
in
hideous
night
when
behold
the
violet
past
prime
and
sable
curls
all
silvered
er
with
white
when
lofty
trees
see
barren
of
leaves
which
erst
from
heat
did
canopy
the
herd
and
summer
green
all
girded
up
in
sheaves
borne
on
the
bier
with
white
and
bristly
beard
then
of
thy
beauty
do
question
make
that
thou
among
the
wastes
of
time
must
go
since
sweets
and
beauties
do
themselves
forsake
and
die
as
fast
as
they
see
others
grow
and
nothing
gainst
time
scythe
can
make
defence
save
breed
to
brave
him
when
he
takes
thee
hence
that
you
were
your
self
but
love
you
are
no
longer
yours
than
you
your
self
here
live
against
this
coming
end
you
should
prepare
and
your
sweet
semblance
to
some
other
give
so
should
that
beauty
which
you
hold
in
lease
find
no
determination
then
you
were
your
self
again
after
your
self
decease
when
your
sweet
issue
your
sweet
form
should
bear
who
lets
so
fair
house
fall
to
decay
which
husbandry
in
honour
might
uphold
against
the
stormy
gusts
of
winter
day
and
barren
rage
of
death
eternal
cold
none
but
unthrifts
dear
my
love
you
know
you
had
father
let
your
son
say
so
not
from
the
stars
do
my
judgement
pluck
and
yet
methinks
have
astronomy
but
not
to
tell
of
good
or
evil
luck
of
plagues
of
dearths
or
seasons
quality
nor
can
fortune
to
brief
minutes
tell
pointing
to
each
his
thunder
rain
and
wind
or
say
with
princes
if
it
shall
go
well
by
oft
predict
that
in
heaven
find
but
from
thine
eyes
my
knowledge
derive
and
constant
stars
in
them
read
such
art
as
truth
and
beauty
shall
together
thrive
if
from
thy
self
to
store
thou
wouldst
convert
or
else
of
thee
this
prognosticate
thy
end
is
truth
and
beauty
doom
and
date
when
consider
every
thing
that
grows
holds
in
perfection
but
little
moment
that
this
huge
stage
presenteth
nought
but
shows
whereon
the
stars
in
secret
influence
comment
when
perceive
that
men
as
plants
increase
cheered
and
checked
even
by
the
self-same
sky
vaunt
in
their
youthful
sap
at
height
decrease
and
wear
their
brave
state
out
of
memory
then
the
conceit
of
this
inconstant
stay
sets
you
most
rich
in
youth
before
my
sight
where
wasteful
time
debateth
with
decay
to
change
your
day
of
youth
to
sullied
night
and
all
in
war
with
time
for
love
of
you
as
he
takes
from
you
engraft
you
new
but
wherefore
do
not
you
mightier
way
make
war
upon
this
bloody
tyrant
time
and
fortify
your
self
in
your
decay
with
means
more
blessed
than
my
barren
rhyme
now
stand
you
on
the
top
of
happy
hours
and
many
maiden
gardens
yet
unset
with
virtuous
wish
would
bear
you
living
flowers
much
liker
than
your
painted
counterfeit
so
should
the
lines
of
life
that
life
repair
which
this
time
pencil
or
my
pupil
pen
neither
in
inward
worth
nor
outward
fair
can
make
you
live
your
self
in
eyes
of
men
to
give
away
your
self
keeps
your
self
still
and
you
must
live
drawn
by
your
own
sweet
skill
who
will
believe
my
verse
in
time
to
come
if
it
were
filled
with
your
most
high
deserts
though
yet
heaven
knows
it
is
but
as
tomb
which
hides
your
life
and
shows
not
half
your
parts
if
could
write
the
beauty
of
your
eyes
and
in
fresh
numbers
number
all
your
graces
the
age
to
come
would
say
this
poet
lies
such
heavenly
touches
ne
er
touched
earthly
faces
so
should
my
papers
yellowed
with
their
age
be
scorned
like
old
men
of
less
truth
than
tongue
and
your
true
rights
be
termed
poet
rage
and
stretched
metre
of
an
antique
song
but
were
some
child
of
yours
alive
that
time
you
should
live
twice
in
it
and
in
my
rhyme
shall
compare
thee
to
summer
day
thou
art
more
lovely
and
more
temperate
rough
winds
do
shake
the
darling
buds
of
may
and
summer
lease
hath
all
too
short
date
sometime
too
hot
the
eye
of
heaven
shines
and
often
is
his
gold
complexion
dimmed
and
every
fair
from
fair
sometime
declines
by
chance
or
nature
changing
course
untrimmed
but
thy
eternal
summer
shall
not
fade
nor
lose
possession
of
that
fair
thou
ow
nor
shall
death
brag
thou
wand
rest
in
his
shade
when
in
eternal
lines
to
time
thou
grow
so
long
as
men
can
breathe
or
eyes
can
see
so
long
lives
this
and
this
gives
life
to
thee
devouring
time
blunt
thou
the
lion
paws
and
make
the
earth
devour
her
own
sweet
brood
pluck
the
keen
teeth
from
the
fierce
tiger
jaws
and
burn
the
long-lived
phoenix
in
her
blood
make
glad
and
sorry
seasons
as
thou
fleet
and
do
whate
er
thou
wilt
swift-footed
time
to
the
wide
world
and
all
her
fading
sweets
but
forbid
thee
one
most
heinous
crime
carve
not
with
thy
hours
my
love
fair
brow
nor
draw
no
lines
there
with
thine
antique
pen
him
in
thy
course
untainted
do
allow
for
beauty
pattern
to
succeeding
men
yet
do
thy
worst
old
time
despite
thy
wrong
my
love
shall
in
my
verse
ever
live
young
woman
face
with
nature
own
hand
painted
hast
thou
the
master
mistress
of
my
passion
woman
gentle
heart
but
not
acquainted
with
shifting
change
as
is
false
women
fashion
an
eye
more
bright
than
theirs
less
false

rolling
gilding
the
object
whereupon
it
gazeth

in

all
hues
in
his
controlling
which
steals
men

and
women
souls
amazeth
and
for
woman
wert
thou
first
created
till
nature
as
she
wrought
thee
fell
a-doting
and
by
addition
me
of
thee
defeated
by
adding
one

to
my

nothing

thee
out
for

use
their
treasure
so
is
it
not
with
me
as
with
that
muse
stirred
by
painted
beauty
to
his
verse
who
heaven
it
self
for
ornament
doth
use
and
every
fair
with
his
fair
doth
rehearse
making
couplement
of
proud
compare
with

with
earth
and
sea
rich
gems
with

first-born
flowers
and
all
things
rare
that
heaven
air
in
this
huge
rondure
hems
let
me
true
in
love
but
truly
write
and
then
believe
me
my
love
is
as
fair
as
any
mother
child
though
not
so
bright
as
those
gold
candles
fixed
in
heaven
air
let
them
say
more
that
like
of
hearsay
well
will
not
praise
that
purpose
not
to
sell
my
glass
shall
not
persuade
me
am
old
so
long
as
youth
and
thou
are
of
one
date
but
when
in
thee
time
furrows
behold
then
look
death
my
days
should
expiate
for
all
that
beauty
that
doth
cover
thee
is
but
the
seemly
raiment
of
my
heart
which
in
thy
breast
doth
live
as
thine
in
me
how
can
then
be
elder
than
thou
art
therefore
love
be
of
thyself
so
wary
as
not
for
my
self
but
for
thee
will
bearing
thy
heart
which
will
keep
so
chary
as
tender
nurse
her
babe
from
faring
ill
presume
not
on
thy
heart
when
mine
is
slain
thou
gav
me
thine
not
to
give
back
again
as
an
unperfect
actor
on
the
stage
who
with
his
fear
is
put
beside
his
part
or
some
fierce
thing
replete
with
too
much
rage
whose
strength
abundance
weakens
his
own
heart
so
for
fear
of
trust
forget
to
say
the
perfect
ceremony
of
love
rite
and
in
mine
own
love
strength
seem
to
decay
ercharged
with
burthen
of
mine
own
love
might
let
my
looks
be
then
the
eloquence
and
dumb
presagers
of
my
speaking
breast
who
plead
for
love
and
look
for
recompense
more
than
that
tongue
that
more
hath
more
expressed
learn
to
read
what
silent
love
hath
writ
to
hear
with
eyes
belongs
to
love
fine
wit
mine
eye
hath
played
the
painter
and
hath
stelled
thy
beauty
form
in
table
of
my
heart
my
body
is
the
frame
wherein
tis
held
and

it
is
best
painter
art
for
through
the
painter
must
you
see
his
skill
to
find
where
your
true
image
pictured
lies
which
in
my
bosom
shop
is
hanging
still
that
hath
his
windows
glazed
with
thine
eyes
now
see
what
good
turns
eyes
for
eyes
have
done
mine
eyes
have
drawn
thy
shape
and
thine
for
me
are
windows
to
my
breast
where-through
the
sun
delights
to
peep
to
gaze
therein
on
thee

cunning
want
to

those

are
in

with
their

of

boast
whilst
whom

such

unlooked

in

most
great

their

as

from

where
may

whom
in

hath
my

strongly
knit
to
thee
send
this
written
embassage
to

duty
not
to

my

duty
so
great
which
wit
so
poor
as
mine
may
make
seem
bare
in
wanting
words
to
show
it
but
that
hope
some
good
conceit
of
thine
in
thy
soul
thought
all
naked
will
bestow
it
till
whatsoever
star
that
guides
my
moving
points
on
me
graciously
with
fair
aspect
and
puts
apparel
on
my
tattered
loving
to
show
me
worthy
of
thy
sweet
respect
then
may
dare
to
boast
how
do
love
thee
till
then
not
show
my
head
where
thou
mayst
prove
me
weary
with
toil
haste
me
to
my
bed
the
dear
respose
for
limbs
with
travel
tired
but
then
begins
journey
in
my
head
to
work
my
mind
when
body
work
expired
for
then
my
thoughts
from
far
where
abide
intend
zealous
pilgrimage
to
thee
and
keep
my
drooping
eyelids
open
wide
looking
on
darkness
which
the
blind
do
see
save
that
my
soul
imaginary
sight
presents
thy
shadow
to
my
sightless
view
which
like
jewel
hung
in
ghastly
night
makes
black
night
beauteous
and
her
old
face
new
lo
thus
by
day
my
limbs
by
night
my
mind
for
thee
and
for
my
self
no
quiet
find
how
can
then
return
in
happy
plight
that
am
debarred
the
benefit
of
rest
when
day
oppression
is
not
eased
by
night
but
day
by
night
and
night
by
day
oppressed
and
each
though
enemies
to
either
reign
do
in
consent
shake
hands
to
torture
me
the
one
by
toil
the
other
to
complain
how
far
toil
still
farther
off
from
thee
tell
the
day
to
please
him
thou
art
bright
and
dost
him
grace
when
clouds
do
blot
the
heaven
so
flatter
the
swart-complexioned
night
when
sparkling
stars
twire
not
thou
gild
the
even
but
day
doth
daily
draw
my
sorrows
longer
and
night
doth
nightly
make
grief
length
seem
stronger
when
in
disgrace
with
fortune
and
men
eyes
all
alone
beweep
my
outcast
state
and
trouble
deaf
heaven
with
my
bootless
cries
and
look
upon
my
self
and
curse
my
fate
wishing
me
like
to
one
more
rich
in
hope
featured
like
him
like
him
with
friends
possessed
desiring
this
man
art
and
that
man
scope
with
what
most
enjoy
contented
least
yet
in
these
thoughts
my
self
almost
despising
haply
think
on
thee
and
then
my
state
like
to
the
lark
at
break
of
day
arising
from
sullen
earth
sings
hymns
at
heaven
gate
for
thy
sweet
love
remembered
such
wealth
brings
that
then
scorn
to
change
my
state
with
kings
when
to
the
sessions
of
sweet
silent
thought
summon
up
remembrance
of
things
past
sigh
the
lack
of
many
thing
sought
and
with
old
woes
new
wail
my
dear
time
waste
then
can
drown
an
eye
unused
to
flow
for
precious
friends
hid
in
death
dateless
night
and
weep
afresh
love
long
since
cancelled
woe
and
moan
th
expense
of
many
vanished
sight
then
can
grieve
at
grievances
foregone
and
heavily
from
woe
to
woe
tell
er
the
sad
account
of
fore-bemoaned
moan
which
new
pay
as
if
not
paid
before
but
if
the
while
think
on
thee
dear
friend
all
losses
are
restored
and
sorrows
end
thy
bosom
is
endeared
with
all
hearts
which
by
lacking
have
supposed
dead
and
there
reigns
love
and
all
love
loving
parts
and
all
those
friends
which
thought
buried
how
many
holy
and
obsequious
tear
hath
dear
religious
love
stol
from
mine
eye
as
interest
of
the
dead
which
now
appear
but
things
removed
that
hidden
in
thee
lie
thou
art
the
grave
where
buried
love
doth
live
hung
with
the
trophies
of
my
lovers
gone
who
all
their
parts
of
me
to
thee
did
give
that
due
of
many
now
is
thine
alone
their
images
loved
view
in
thee
and
thou
all
they
hast
all
the
all
of
me
if
thou
survive
my
well-contented
day
when
that
churl
death
my
bones
with
dust
shall
cover
and
shalt
by
fortune
once
more
re-survey
these
poor
rude
lines
of
thy
deceased
lover
compare
them
with
the
bett
ring
of
the
time
and
though
they
be
outstripped
by
every
pen
reserve
them
for
my
love
not
for
their
rhyme
exceeded
by
the
height
of
happier
men
then
vouchsafe
me
but
this
loving
thought
had
my
friend
muse
grown
with
this
growing
age
dearer
birth
than
this
his
love
had
brought
to
march
in
ranks
of
better
equipage
but
since
he
died
and
poets
better
prove
theirs
for
their
style
ll
read
his
for
his
love
full
many
glorious
morning
have
seen
flatter
the
mountain
tops
with
sovereign
eye
kissing
with
golden
face
the
meadows
green
gilding
pale
streams
with
heavenly
alchemy
anon
permit
the
basest
clouds
to
ride
with
ugly
rack
on
his
celestial
face
and
from
the
forlorn
world
his
visage
hide
stealing
unseen
to
west
with
this
disgrace
even
so
my
sun
one
early
morn
did
shine
with
all
triumphant
splendour
on
my
brow
but
out
alack
he
was
but
one
hour
mine
the
region
cloud
hath
masked
him
from
me
now
yet
him
for
this
my
love
no
whit
disdaineth
suns
of
the
world
may
stain
when
heaven
sun
staineth
why
didst
thou
promise
such
beauteous
day
and
make
me
travel
forth
without
my
cloak
to
let
base
clouds
ertake
me
in
my
way
hiding
thy
brav
ry
in
their
rotten
smoke
tis
not
enough
that
through
the
cloud
thou
break
to
dry
the
rain
on
my
storm-beaten
face
for
no
man
well
of
such
salve
can
speak
that
heals
the
wound
and
cures
not
the
disgrace
nor
can
thy
shame
give
physic
to
my
grief
though
thou
repent
yet
have
still
the
loss
th
offender
sorrow
lends
but
weak
relief
to
him
that
bears
the
strong
offence
cross
ah
but
those
tears
are
pearl
which
thy
love
sheds
and
they
are
rich
and
ransom
all
ill
deeds
no
more
be
grieved
at
that
which
thou
hast
done
roses
have
thorns
and
silver
fountains
mud
clouds
and
eclipses
stain
both
moon
and

and
loathsome
canker

all

and
even
in
this
authorizing
thy

with
compare
my

corrupting
salving
thy
amiss
excusing
thy
sins
more
than
thy
sins
are
for
to
thy
sensual
fault
bring
in
sense
thy
adverse
party
is
thy
advocate
and
gainst
my
self
lawful
plea
commence
such
civil
war
is
in
my
love
and
hate
that
an
accessary
needs
must
be
to
that
sweet
thief
which
sourly
robs
from
me
let
me
confess
that
we
two
must
be
twain
although
our
undivided
loves
are
one
so
shall
those
blots
that
do
with
me
remain
without
thy
help
by
me
be
borne
alone
in
our
two
loves
there
is
but
one
respect
though
in
our
lives
separable
spite
which
though
it
alter
not
love
sole
effect
yet
doth
it
steal
sweet
hours
from
love
delight
may
not
evermore
acknowledge
thee
lest
my
bewailed
guilt
should
do
thee
shame
nor
thou
with
public
kindness
honour
me
unless
thou
take
that
honour
from
thy
name
but
do
not
so
love
thee
in
such
sort
as
thou
being
mine
mine
is
thy
good
report
as
decrepit
father
takes
delight
to
see
his
active
child
do
deeds
of
youth
so
made
lame
by
fortune
dearest
spite
take
all
my
comfort
of
thy
worth
and
truth
for
whether
beauty
birth
or
wealth
or
wit
or
any
of
these
all
or
all
or
more
entitled
in
thy
parts
do
crowned
sit
make
my
love
engrafted
to
this
store
so
then
am
not
lame
poor
nor
despised
whilst
that
this
shadow
doth
such
substance
give
that
in
thy
abundance
am
sufficed
and
by
part
of
all
thy
glory
live
look
what
is
best
that
best
wish
in
thee
this
wish
have
then
ten
times
happy
me
how
can
my
muse
want
subject
to
invent
while
thou
dost
breathe
that
pour
into
my
verse
thine
own
sweet
argument
too
excellent
for
every
vulgar
paper
to
rehearse
give
thy
self
the
thanks
if
aught
in
me
worthy
perusal
stand
against
thy
sight
for
who
so
dumb
that
cannot
write
to
thee
when
thou
thy
self
dost
give
invention
light
be
thou
the
tenth
muse
ten
times
more
in
worth
than
those
old
nine
which
rhymers
invocate
and
he
that
calls
on
thee
let
him
bring
forth
eternal
numbers
to
outlive
long
date
if
my
slight
muse
do
please
these
curious
days
the
pain
be
mine
but
thine
shall
be
the
praise
how
thy
worth
with
manners
may
sing
when
thou
art
all
the
better
part
of
me
what
can
mine
own
praise
to
mine
own
self
bring
and
what
ist
but
mine
own
when
praise
thee
even
for
this
let
us
divided
live
and
our
dear
love
lose
name
of
single
one
that
by
this
separation
may
give
that
due
to
thee
which
thou
deserv
alone
absence
what
torment
wouldst
thou
prove
were
it
not
thy
sour
leisure
gave
sweet
leave
to
entertain
the
time
with
thoughts
of
love
which
time
and
thoughts
so
sweetly
doth
deceive
and
that
thou
teachest
how
to
make
one
twain
by
praising
him
here
who
doth
hence
remain
take
all
my
loves
my
love
yea
take
them
all
what
hast
thou
then
more
than
thou
hadst
before
no
love
my
love
that
thou
mayst
true
love
call
all
mine
was
thine
before
thou
hadst
this
more
then
if
for
my
love
thou
my
love
receivest
cannot
blame
thee
for
my
love
thou
usest
but
yet
be
blamed
if
thou
thy
self
deceivest
by
wilful
taste
of
what
thy
self
refusest
do
forgive
thy
robbery
gentle
thief
although
thou
steal
thee
all
my
poverty
and
yet
love
knows
it
is
greater
grief
to
bear
greater
wrong
than
hate
known
injury
lascivious
grace
in
whom
all
ill
well
shows
kill
me
with
spites
yet
we
must
not
be
foes
those
pretty
wrongs
that
liberty
commits
when
am
sometime
absent
from
thy
heart
thy
beauty
and
thy
years
full
well
befits
for
still
temptation
follows
where
thou
art
gentle
thou
art
and
therefore
to
be
won
beauteous
thou
art
therefore
to
be
assailed
and
when
woman
woos
what
woman
son
will
sourly
leave
her
till
he
have
prevailed
ay
me
but
yet
thou
mightst
my
seat
forbear
and
chide
thy
beauty
and
thy
straying
youth
who
lead
thee
in
their
riot
even
there
where
thou
art
forced
to
break
twofold
truth
hers
by
thy
beauty
tempting
her
to
thee
thine
by
thy
beauty
being
false
to
me
that
thou
hast
her
it
is
not
all
my
grief
and
yet
it
may
be
said
loved
her
dearly
that
she
hath
thee
is
of
my
wailing
chief
loss
in
love
that
touches
me
more
nearly
loving
offenders
thus
will
excuse
ye
thou
dost
love
her
because
thou
know
love
her
and
for
my
sake
even
so
doth
she
abuse
me
suff
ring
my
friend
for
my
sake
to
approve
her
if
lose
thee
my
loss
is
my
love
gain
and
losing
her
my
friend
hath
found
that
loss
both
find
each
other
and
lose
both
twain
and
both
for
my
sake
lay
on
me
this
cross
but
here
the
joy
my
friend
and
are
one
sweet
flattery
then
she
loves
but
me
alone
when
most
wink
then
do
mine
eyes
best
see
for
all
the
day
they
view
things
unrespected
but
when
sleep
in
dreams
they
look
on
thee
and
darkly
bright
are
bright
in
dark
directed
then
thou
whose
shadow
shadows
doth
make
bright
how
would
thy
shadow
form
form
happy
show
to
the
clear
day
with
thy
much
clearer
light
when
to
unseeing
eyes
thy
shade
shines
so
how
would
say
mine
eyes
be
blessed
made
by
looking
on
thee
in
the
living
day
when
in
dead
night
thy
fair
imperfect
shade
through
heavy
sleep
on
sightless
eyes
doth
stay
all
days
are
nights
to
see
till
see
thee
and
nights
bright
days
when
dreams
do
show
thee
me
if
the
dull
substance
of
my
flesh
were
thought
injurious
distance
should
not
stop
my
way
for
then
despite
of
space
would
be
brought
from
limits
far
remote
where
thou
dost
stay
no
matter
then
although
my
foot
did
stand
upon
the
farthest
earth
removed
from
thee
for
nimble
thought
can
jump
both
sea
and
land
as
soon
as
think
the
place
where
he
would
be
but
ah
thought
kills
me
that
am
not
thought
to
leap
large
lengths
of
miles
when
thou
art
gone
but
that
so
much
of
earth
and
water
wrought
must
attend
time
leisure
with
my
moan
receiving
nought
by
elements
so
slow
but
heavy
tears
badges
of
either
woe
the
other
two
slight
air
and
purging
fire
are
both
with
thee
wherever
abide
the
first
my
thought
the
other
my
desire
these
present-absent
with
swift
motion
slide
for
when
these
quicker
elements
are
gone
in
tender
embassy
of
love
to
thee
my
life
being
made
of
four
with
two
alone
sinks
down
to
death
oppressed
with
melancholy
until
life
composition
be
recured
by
those
swift
messengers
returned
from
thee
who
even
but
now
come
back
again
assured
of
thy
fair
health
recounting
it
to
me
this
told
joy
but
then
no
longer
glad
send
them
back
again
and
straight
grow
sad
mine
eye
and
heart
are
at
mortal
war
how
to
divide
the
conquest
of
thy
sight
mine
eye
my
heart
thy
picture
sight
would
bar
my
heart
mine
eye
the
freedom
of
that
right
my
heart
doth
plead
that
thou
in
him
dost
lie
closet
never
pierced
with
crystal
eyes
but
the
defendant
doth
that
plea
deny
and
says
in
him
thy
fair
appearance
lies
to
side
this
title
is
impanelled
quest
of
thoughts
all
tenants
to
the
heart
and
by
their
verdict
is
determined
the
clear
eye
moiety
and
the
dear
heart
part
as
thus
mine
eye
due
is
thy
outward
part
and
my
heart
right
thy
inward
love
of
heart
betwixt
mine
eye
and
heart
league
is
took
and
each
doth
good
turns
now
unto
the
other
when
that
mine
eye
is
famished
for
look
or
heart
in
love
with
sighs
himself
doth
smother
with
my
love
picture
then
my
eye
doth
feast
and
to
the
painted
banquet
bids
my
heart
another
time
mine
eye
is
my
heart
guest
and
in
his
thoughts
of
love
doth
share
part
so
either
by
thy
picture
or
my
love
thy
self
away
art
present
still
with
me
for
thou
not
farther
than
my
thoughts
canst
move
and
am
still
with
them
and
they
with
thee
or
if
they
sleep
thy
picture
in
my
sight
awakes
my
heart
to
heart
and
eye
delight
how
careful
was
when
took
my
way
each
trifle
under
truest
bars
to
thrust
that
to
my
use
it
might
unused
stay
from
hands
of
falsehood
in
sure
wards
of
trust
but
thou
to
whom
my
jewels
trifles
are
most
worthy
comfort
now
my
greatest
grief
thou
best
of
dearest
and
mine
only
care
art
left
the
prey
of
every
vulgar
thief
thee
have
not
locked
up
in
any
chest
save
where
thou
art
not
though
feel
thou
art
within
the
gentle
closure
of
my
breast
from
whence
at
pleasure
thou
mayst
come
and
part
and
even
thence
thou
wilt
be
stol
fear
for
truth
proves
thievish
for
prize
so
dear
against
that
time
if
ever
that
time
come
when
shall
see
thee
frown
on
my
defects
when
as
thy
love
hath
cast
his
utmost
sum
called
to
that
audit
by
advised
respects
against
that
time
when
thou
shalt
strangely
pass
and
scarcely
greet
me
with
that
sun
thine
eye
when
love
converted
from
the
thing
it
was
shall
reasons
find
of
settled
gravity
against
that
time
do
ensconce
me
here
within
the
knowledge
of
mine
own
desert
and
this
my
hand
against
my
self
uprear
to
guard
the
lawful
reasons
on
thy
part
to
leave
poor
me
thou
hast
the
strength
of
laws
since
why
to
love
can
allege
no
cause
how
heavy
do
journey
on
the
way
when
what
seek
my
weary
travel
end
doth
teach
that
case
and
that
repose
to
say
thus
far
the
miles
are
measured
from
thy
friend
the
beast
that
bears
me
tired
with
my
woe
plods
dully
on
to
bear
that
weight
in
me
as
if
by
some
instinct
the
wretch
did
know
his
rider
loved
not
speed
being
made
from
thee
the
bloody
spur
cannot
provoke
him
on
that
sometimes
anger
thrusts
into
his
hide
which
heavily
he
answers
with
groan
more
sharp
to
me
than
spurring
to
his
side
for
that
same
groan
doth
put
this
in
my
mind
my
grief
lies
onward
and
my
joy
behind
thus
can
my
love
excuse
the
slow
offence
of
my
dull
bearer
when
from
thee
speed
from
where
thou
art
why
should
haste
me
thence
till
return
of
posting
is
no
need
what
excuse
will
my
poor
beast
then
find
when
swift
extremity
can
seem
but
slow
then
should
spur
though
mounted
on
the
wind
in
winged
speed
no
motion
shall
know
then
can
no
horse
with
my
desire
keep
pace
therefore
desire
of
perfect
love
being
made
shall
neigh
no
dull
flesh
in
his
fiery
race
but
love
for
love
thus
shall
excuse
my
jade
since
from
thee
going
he
went
wilful-slow
towards
thee
ll
run
and
give
him
leave
to
go
so
am
as
the
rich
whose
blessed
key
can
bring
him
to
his
sweet
up-locked
treasure
the
which
he
will
not
every
hour
survey
for
blunting
the
fine
point
of
seldom
pleasure
therefore
are
feasts
so
solemn
and
so
rare
since
seldom
coming
in
that
long
year
set
like
stones
of
worth
they
thinly
placed
are
or
captain
jewels
in
the
carcanet
so
is
the
time
that
keeps
you
as
my
chest
or
as
the
wardrobe
which
the
robe
doth
hide
to
make
some
special
instant
special-blest
by
new
unfolding
his
imprisoned
pride
blessed
are
you
whose
worthiness
gives
scope
being
had
to
triumph
being
lacked
to
hope
what
is
your
substance
whereof
are
you
made
that
millions
of
strange
shadows
on
you
tend
since
every
one
hath
every
one
one
shade
and
you
but
one
can
every
shadow
lend
describe
adonis
and
the
counterfeit
is
poorly
imitated
after
you
on
helen
cheek
all
art
of
beauty
set
and
you
in
grecian
tires
are
painted
new
speak
of
the
spring
and
foison
of
the
year
the
one
doth
shadow
of
your
beauty
show
the
other
as
your
bounty
doth
appear
and
you
in
every
blessed
shape
we
know
in
all
external
grace
you
have
some
part
but
you
like
none
none
you
for
constant
heart
how
much
more
doth
beauty
beauteous
seem
by
that
sweet
ornament
which
truth
doth
give
the
rose
looks
fair
but
fairer
we
it
deem
for
that
sweet
odour
which
doth
in
it
live
the
canker
blooms
have
full
as
deep
dye
as
the
perfumed
tincture
of
the
roses
hang
on
such
thorns
and
play
as
wantonly
when
summer
breath
their
masked
buds
discloses
but
for
their
virtue
only
is
their
show
they
live
unwooed
and
unrespected
fade
die
to
themselves
sweet
roses
do
not
so
of
their
sweet
deaths
are
sweetest
odours
made
and
so
of
you
beauteous
and
lovely
youth
when
that
shall
vade
by
verse
distills
your
truth
not
marble
nor
the
gilded
monuments
of
princes
shall
outlive
this
powerful
rhyme
but
you
shall
shine
more
bright
in
these
contents
than
unswept
stone
besmeared
with
sluttish
time
when
wasteful
war
shall
statues
overturn
and
broils
root
out
the
work
of
masonry
nor
mars
his
sword
nor
war
quick
fire
shall
burn
the
living
record
of
your
memory
gainst
death
and
all-oblivious
enmity
shall
you
pace
forth
your
praise
shall
still
find
room
even
in
the
eyes
of
all
posterity
that
wear
this
world
out
to
the
ending
doom
so
till
the
judgment
that
your
self
arise
you
live
in
this

dwell
in
lovers
eyes
sweet

renew
thy
force

it
not

thy
edge
should
blunter
be
than
appetite
which
but
to-day
by
feeding
is
allayed
to-morrow
sharpened
in
his
former
might
so
love
be
thou
although
to-day
thou
fill
thy
hungry
eyes
even
till
they
wink
with
fulness
to-morrow
see
again
and
do
not
kill
the
spirit
of
love
with
perpetual
dulness
let
this
sad
interim
like
the
ocean
be
which
parts
the
shore
where
two
contracted
new
come
daily
to
the
banks
that
when
they
see
return
of
love
more
blest
may
be
the

call
it
winter
which
being
full
of
care
makes
summer
welcome
thrice
more
wished
more
rare
being
your

upon

your

once
adieu
nor

question
with
my
jealous

where
you
may

that
record
could
with
backward
look
even
of
five
hundred
courses
of
the
sun
show
me
your
image
in
some
antique

since
mind
at

that

for
his

my

shall
stand
praising
thy

despite
his

it
thy

thy

my
heavy

to
the

from

to
pry

in

no
thy
love
though
much
is
not
so
great
it
is
my
love
that
keeps
mine
eye
awake
mine
own
true
love
that
doth
my
rest
defeat
to
play
the
watchman
ever
for
thy

for
thee

whilst
thou
dost
wake
elsewhere
from

far
off
with

all
too
near
sin
of
self-love
possesseth
all
mine
eye
and
all
my
soul
and
all
my
every
part
and
for
this
sin
there
is
no
remedy
it
is
so
grounded
inward
in
my
heart
methinks
no
face
so
gracious
is
as
mine
no
shape
so
true
no
truth
of
such
account
and
for
my
self
mine
own
worth
do
define
as
all
other
in
all
worths
surmount
but
when
my
glass
shows
me
my
self
indeed
beated
and
chopt
with
tanned
antiquity
mine
own
self-love
quite
contrary
read
self
so
self-loving
were
iniquity
tis
thee
my
self
that
for
my
self
praise
painting
my
age
with
beauty
of
thy
days
against
my
love
shall
be
as
am
now
with
time
injurious
hand
crushed
and
erworn
when
hours
have
drained
his
blood
and
filled
his
brow
with
lines
and
wrinkles
when
his
youthful
morn
hath
travelled
on
to
age
steepy
night
and
all
those
beauties
whereof
now
he
king
are
vanishing
or
vanished
out
of
sight
stealing
away
the
treasure
of
his
spring
for
such
time
do
now
fortify
against
confounding
age
cruel
knife
that
he
shall
never
cut
from
memory
my
sweet
love
beauty
though
my
lover
life
his
beauty
shall
in
these
black
lines
be
seen
and
they
shall
live
and
he
in
them
still
green
when
have
seen
by
time
fell
hand
defaced
the
rich-proud
cost
of
outworn
buried
age
when
sometime
lofty
towers
see
down-rased
and
brass
eternal
slave
to
mortal
rage
when
have
seen
the
hungry
ocean
gain
advantage
on
the
kingdom
of
the
shore
and
the
firm
soil
win
of
the
watery
main
increasing
store
with
loss
and
loss
with
store
when
have
seen
such
interchange
of
state
or
state
it
self
confounded
to
decay
ruin
hath
taught
me
thus
to
ruminate
that
time
will
come
and
take
my
love
away
this
thought
is
as
death
which
cannot
choose
but
weep
to
have
that
which
it
fears
to
lose
since
brass
nor
stone
nor
earth
nor
boundless
sea
but
sad
mortality
ersways
their
power
how
with
this
rage
shall
beauty
hold
plea
whose
action
is
no
stronger
than
flower
how
shall
summer
honey
breath
hold
out
against
the
wrackful
siege
of
batt
ring
days
when
rocks
impregnable
are
not
so
stout
nor
gates
of
steel
so
strong
but
time
decays
fearful
meditation
where
alack
shall
time
best
jewel
from

chest
lie
hid

what
strong
hand
can
hold
his
swift
foot
back
or
who
his

of
beauty
can
forbid
none
unless
this
miracle
have
might
that
in
black
ink
my
love
may
still
shine
bright
tired
with
all
these
for
restful
death
cry
as
to
behold
desert
beggar
born
and
needy
nothing
trimmed
in
jollity
and
purest
faith
unhappily
forsworn
and
gilded
honour
shamefully
misplaced
and
maiden
virtue
rudely
strumpeted
and
right
perfection
wrongfully
disgraced
and
strength
by
limping
sway
disabled
and

made
tongue-tied
by
authority
and
folly
doctor-like
controlling
skill
and
simple
truth
miscalled
simplicity
and
captive
good
attending
captain
ill
tired
with
all
these
from
these
would
be
gone
save
that
to
die
leave
my
love
alone
ah
wherefore
with
infection
should
he
live
and
with
his
presence
grace
impiety
that
sin
by
him
advantage
should
achieve
and
lace
it
self
with
his
society
why
should
false
painting
imitate
his
cheek
and
steal
dead
seeming
of
his
living
hue
why
should
poor
beauty
indirectly
seek
roses
of
shadow
since
his
rose
is
true
why
should
he
live
now
nature
bankrupt
is
beggared
of
blood
to
blush
through
lively
veins
for
she
hath
no
exchequer
now
but
his
and
proud
of
many
lives
upon
his
gains
him
she
stores
to
show
what
wealth
she
had
in
days
long
since
before
these
last
so
bad
thus
is
his
cheek
the
map
of
days
outworn
when
beauty
lived
and
died
as
flowers
do
now
before
these
bastard
signs
of
fair
were
born
or
durst
inhabit
on
living
brow
before
the
golden
tresses
of
the
dead
the
right
of
sepulchres
were
shorn
away
to
live
second
life
on
second
head
ere
beauty
dead
fleece
made
another
gay
in
him
those
holy
antique
hours
are
seen
without
all
ornament
it
self
and
true
making
no
summer
of
another
green
robbing
no
old
to
dress
his
beauty
new
and
him
as
for
map
doth
nature
store
to
show
false
art
what
beauty
was
of
yore
those
parts
of
thee
that
the
world
eye
doth
view
want
nothing
that
the
thought
of
hearts
can
mend
all
tongues
the
voice
of
souls
give
thee
that
due
uttering
bare
truth
even
so
as
foes
commend
thy
outward
thus
with
outward
praise
is
crowned
but
those
same
tongues
that
give
thee
so
thine
own
in
other
accents
do
this
praise
confound
by
seeing
farther
than
the
eye
hath
shown
they
look
into
the
beauty
of
thy
mind
and
that
in
guess
they
measure
by
thy
deeds
then
churls
their
thoughts
although
their
eyes
were
kind
to
thy
fair
flower
add
the
rank
smell
of
weeds
but
why
thy
odour
matcheth
not
thy
show
the
soil
is
this
that
thou
dost
common
grow
that
thou
art
blamed
shall
not
be
thy
defect
for
slander
mark
was
ever
yet
the
fair
the
ornament
of
beauty
is
suspect
crow
that
flies
in
heaven
sweetest
air
so
thou
be
good
slander
doth
but
approve
thy
worth
the
greater
being
wooed
of
time
for
canker
vice
the
sweetest
buds
doth
love
and
thou
present
pure
unstained
prime
thou
hast
passed
by
the
ambush
of
young
days
either
not
assailed
or
victor
being
charged
yet
this
thy
praise
cannot
be
so
thy
praise
to
tie
up
envy
evermore
enlarged
if
some
suspect
of
ill
masked
not
thy
show
then
thou
alone
kingdoms
of
hearts
shouldst
owe
no
longer
mourn
for
me
when
am
dead
than
you
shall
hear
the
surly
sullen
bell
give
warning
to
the
world
that
am
fled
from
this
vile
world
with
vilest
worms
to
dwell
nay
if
you
read
this
line
remember
not
the
hand
that
writ
it
for
love
you
so
that
in
your
sweet
thoughts
would
be
forgot
if
thinking
on
me
then
should
make
you
woe
if
say
you
look
upon
this
verse
when
perhaps
compounded
am
with
clay
do
not
so
much
as
my
poor
name
rehearse
but
let
your
love
even
with
my
life
decay
lest
the
wise
world
should
look
into
your
moan
and
mock
you
with
me
after
am
gone
lest
the
world
should
task
you
to
recite
what
merit
lived
in
me
that
you
should
love
after
my
death
dear
love
forget
me
quite
for
you
in
me
can
nothing
worthy
prove
unless
you
would
devise
some
virtuous
lie
to
do
more
for
me
than
mine
own
desert
and
hang
more
praise
upon
deceased
than
niggard
truth
would
willingly
impart
lest
your
true
love
may
seem
false
in
this
that
you
for
love
speak
well
of
me
untrue
my
name
be
buried
where
my
body
is
and
live
no
more
to
shame
nor
me
nor
you
for
am
shamed
by
that
which
bring
forth
and
so
should
you
to
love
things
nothing
worth
that
time
of
year
thou
mayst
in
me
behold
when
yellow
leaves
or
none
or
few
do
hang
upon
those
boughs
which
shake
against
the
cold
bare
ruined
choirs
where
late
the
sweet
birds
sang
in
me
thou
seest
the
twilight
of
such
day
as
after
sunset
fadeth
in
the
west
which
by
and
by
black
night
doth
take
away
death
second
self
that
seals
up
all
in
rest
in
me
thou
seest
the
glowing
of
such
fire
that
on
the
ashes
of
his
youth
doth
lie
as
the
death-bed
whereon
it
must
expire
consumed
with
that
which
it
was
nourished
by
this
thou
perceiv
which
makes
thy
love
more
strong
to
love
that
well
which
thou
must
leave
ere
long
but
be
contented
when
that
fell
arrest
without
all
bail
shall
carry
me
away
my
life
hath
in
this
line
some
interest
which
for
memorial
still
with
thee
shall
stay
when
thou
reviewest
this
thou
dost
review
the
very
part
was
consecrate
to
thee
the
earth
can
have
but
earth
which
is
his
due
my
spirit
is
thine
the
better
part
of
me
so
then
thou
hast
but
lost
the
dregs
of
life
the
prey
of
worms
my
body
being
dead
the
coward
conquest
of
wretch
knife
too
base
of
thee
to
be
remembered
the
worth
of
that
is
that
which
it
contains
and
that
is
this
and
this
with
thee
remains
so
are
you
to
my
thoughts
as
food
to
life
or
as
sweet-seasoned
showers
are
to
the
ground
and
for
the
peace
of
you
hold
such
strife
as
twixt
miser
and
his
wealth
is
found
now
proud
as
an
enjoyer
and
anon
doubting
the
filching
age
will
steal
his
treasure
now
counting
best
to
be
with
you
alone
then
bettered
that
the
world
may
see
my
pleasure
sometime
all
full
with
feasting
on
your
sight
and
by
and
by
clean
starved
for
look
possessing
or
pursuing
no
delight
save
what
is
had
or
must
from
you
be
took
thus
do
pine
and
surfeit
day
by
day
or
gluttoning
on
all
or
all
away
why
is
my
verse
so
barren
of
new
pride
so
far
from
variation
or
quick
change
why
with
the
time
do
not
glance
aside
to
new-found
methods
and
to
compounds
strange
why
write
still
all
one
ever
the
same
and
keep
invention
in
noted
weed
that
every
word
doth
almost
tell
my
name
showing
their
birth
and
where
they
did
proceed
know
sweet
love
always
write
of
you
and
you
and
love
are
still
my
argument
so
all
my
best
is
dressing
old
words
new
spending
again
what
is
already
spent
for
as
the
sun
is
daily
new
and
old
so
is
my
love
still
telling
what
is
told
thy
glass
will
show
thee
how
thy
beauties
wear
thy
dial
how
thy
precious
minutes
waste
these
vacant
leaves
thy
mind
imprint
will
bear
and
of
this
book
this
learning
mayst
thou
taste
the
wrinkles
which
thy
glass
will
truly
show
of
mouthed
graves
will
give
thee
memory
thou
by
thy
dial
shady
stealth
mayst
know
time
thievish
progress
to
eternity
look
what
thy
memory
cannot
contain
commit
to
these
waste
blanks
and
thou
shalt
find
those
children
nursed
delivered
from
thy
brain
to
take
new
acquaintance
of
thy
mind
these
offices
so
oft
as
thou
wilt
look
shall
profit
thee
and
much
enrich
thy
book
so
oft
have
invoked
thee
for
my
muse
and
found
such
fair
assistance
in
my
verse
as
every
alien
pen
hath
got
my
use
and
under
thee
their
poesy
disperse
thine
eyes
that
taught
the
dumb
on
high
to
sing
and
heavy
ignorance
aloft
to
fly
have
added
feathers
to
the
learned
wing
and
given
grace
double
majesty
yet
be
most
proud
of
that
which
compile
whose
influence
is
thine
and
born
of
thee
in
others
works
thou
dost
but
mend
the
style
and
arts
with
thy
sweet
graces
graced
be
but
thou
art
all
my
art
and
dost
advance
as
high
as
learning
my
rude
ignorance
whilst
alone
did
call
upon
thy
aid
my
verse
alone
had
all
thy
gentle
grace
but
now
my
gracious
numbers
are
decayed
and
my
sick
muse
doth
give
an
other
place
grant
sweet
love
thy
lovely
argument
deserves
the
travail
of
worthier
pen
yet
what
of
thee
thy
poet
doth
invent
he
robs
thee
of
and
pays
it
thee
again
he
lends
thee
virtue
and
he
stole
that
word
from
thy
behaviour
beauty
doth
he
give
and
found
it
in
thy
cheek
he
can
afford
no
praise
to
thee
but
what
in
thee
doth
live
then
thank
him
not
for
that
which
he
doth
say
since
what
he
owes
thee
thou
thy
self
dost
pay
how
faint
when
of
you
do
write
knowing
better
spirit
doth
use
your
name
and
in
the
praise
thereof
spends
all
his
might
to
make
me
tongue-tied
speaking
of
your
fame
but
since
your
worth
wide
as
the
ocean
is
the
humble
as
the
proudest
sail
doth
bear
my
saucy
bark
inferior
far
to
his
on
your
broad
main
doth
wilfully
appear
your
shallowest
help
will
hold
me
up
afloat
whilst
he
upon
your
soundless
deep
doth
ride
or
being
wrecked
am
worthless
boat
he
of
tall
building
and
of
goodly
pride
then
if
he
thrive
and
be
cast
away
the
worst
was
this
my
love
was
my
decay
or
shall
live
your
epitaph
to
make
or
you
survive
when
in
earth
am
rotten
from
hence
your
memory
death
cannot
take
although
in
me
each
part
will
be
forgotten
your
name
from
hence
immortal
life
shall
have
though
once
gone
to
all
the
world
must
die
the
earth
can
yield
me
but
common
grave
when
you
entombed
in
men
eyes
shall
lie
your
monument
shall
be
my
gentle
verse
which
eyes
not
yet
created
shall
er-read
and
tongues
to
be
your
being
shall
rehearse
when
all
the
breathers
of
this
world
are
dead
you
still
shall
live
such
virtue
hath
my
pen
where
breath
most
breathes
even
in
the
mouths
of
men
grant
thou
wert
not
married
to
my
muse
and
therefore
mayst
without
attaint
erlook
the
dedicated
words
which
writers
use
of
their
fair
subject
blessing
every
book
thou
art
as
fair
in
knowledge
as
in
hue
finding
thy
worth
limit
past
my
praise
and
therefore
art
enforced
to
seek
anew
some
fresher
stamp
of
the
time-bettering
days
and
do
so
love
yet
when
they
have
devised
what
strained
touches
rhetoric
can
lend
thou
truly
fair
wert
truly
sympathized
in
true
plain
words
by
thy
true-telling
friend
and
their
gross
painting
might
be
better
used
where
cheeks
need
blood
in
thee
it
is
abused
never
saw
that
you
did
painting
need
and
therefore
to
your
fair
no
painting
set
found
or
thought
found
you
did
exceed
that
barren
tender
of
poet
debt
and
therefore
have
slept
in
your
report
that
you
your
self
being
extant
well
might
show
how
far
modern
quill
doth
come
too
short
speaking
of
worth
what
worth
in
you
doth
grow
this
silence
for
my
sin
you
did
impute
which
shall
be
most
my
glory
being
dumb
for
impair
not
beauty
being
mute
when
others
would
give
life
and
bring
tomb
there
lives
more
life
in
one
of
your
fair
eyes
than
both
your
poets
can
in
praise
devise
who
is
it
that
says
most
which
can
say
more
than
this
rich
praise
that
you
alone
are
you
in
whose
confine
immured
is
the
store
which
should
example
where
your
equal
grew
lean
penury
within
that
pen
doth
dwell
that
to
his
subject
lends
not
some
small
glory
but
he
that
writes
of
you
if
he
can
tell
that
you
are
you
so
dignifies
his
story
let
him
but
copy
what
in
you
is
writ
not
making
worse
what
nature
made
so
clear
and
such
counterpart
shall
fame
his
wit
making
his
style
admired
every
where
you
to
your
beauteous
blessings
add
curse
being
fond
on
praise
which
makes
your
praises
worse
my
tongue-tied
muse
in
manners
holds
her
still
while
comments
of
your
praise
richly
compiled
reserve
their
character
with
golden
quill
and
precious
phrase
by
all
the
muses
filed
think
good
thoughts
whilst
other
write
good
words
and
like
unlettered
clerk
still
cry
amen
to
every
hymn
that
able
spirit
affords
in
polished
form
of
well
refined
pen
hearing
you
praised
say
tis
so
tis
true
and
to
the
most
of
praise
add
something
more
but
that
is
in
my
thought
whose
love
to
you
though
words
come
hindmost
holds
his
rank
before
then
others
for
the
breath
of
words
respect
me
for
my
dumb
thoughts
speaking
in
effect
was
it
the
proud
full
sail
of
his
great
verse
bound
for
the
prize
of
all
too
precious
you
that
did
my
ripe
thoughts
in
my
brain
inhearse
making
their
tomb
the
womb
wherein
they
grew
was
it
his
spirit
by
spirits
taught
to
write
above
mortal
pitch
that
struck
me
dead
no
neither
he
nor
his
compeers
by
night
giving
him
aid
my
verse
astonished
he
nor
that
affable
familiar
ghost
which
nightly
gulls
him
with
intelligence
as
victors
of
my
silence
cannot
boast
was
not
sick
of
any
fear
from
thence
but
when
your
countenance
filled
up
his
line
then
lacked
matter
that
enfeebled
mine
farewell
thou
art
too
dear
for
my
possessing
and
like
enough
thou
know
thy
estimate
the
charter
of
thy
worth
gives
thee
releasing
my
bonds
in
thee
are
all
determinate
for
how
do
hold
thee
but
by
thy
granting
and
for
that
riches
where
is
my
deserving
the
cause
of
this
fair
gift
in
me
is
wanting
and
so
my
patent
back
again
is
swerving
thy
self
thou
gav
thy
own
worth
then
not
knowing
or
me
to
whom
thou
gav
it
else
mistaking
so
thy
great
gift
upon
misprision
growing
comes
home
again
on
better
judgement
making
thus
have
had
thee
as
dream
doth
flatter
in
sleep
king
but
waking
no
such
matter
when
thou
shalt
be
disposed
to
set
me
light
and
place
my
merit
in
the
eye
of
scorn
upon
thy
side
against
my
self
ll
fight
and
prove
thee
virtuous
though
thou
art
forsworn
with
mine
own
weakness
being
best
acquainted
upon
thy
part
can
set
down
story
of
faults
concealed
wherein
am
attainted
that
thou
in
losing
me
shalt
win
much
glory
and
by
this
will
be
gainer
too
for
bending
all
my
loving
thoughts
on
thee
the
injuries
that
to
my
self
do
doing
thee
vantage
double-vantage
me
such
is
my
love
to
thee
so
belong
that
for
thy
right
my
self
will
bear
all
wrong
say
that
thou
didst
forsake
me
for
some
fault
and
will
comment
upon
that
offence
speak
of
my
lameness
and
straight
will
halt
against
thy
reasons
making
no
defence
thou
canst
not
love
disgrace
me
half
so
ill
to
set
form
upon
desired
change
as
ll
my
self
disgrace
knowing
thy
will
will
acquaintance
strangle
and
look
strange
be
absent
from
thy
walks
and
in
my
tongue
thy
sweet
beloved
name
no
more
shall
dwell
lest
too
much
profane
should
do
it
wronk
and
haply
of
our
old
acquaintance
tell
for
thee
against
my
self
ll
vow
debate
for
must
ne
er
love
him
whom
thou
dost
hate
then
hate
me
when
thou
wilt
if
ever
now
now
while
the
world
is
bent
my
deeds
to
cross
join
with
the
spite
of
fortune
make
me
bow
and
do
not
drop
in
for
an
after-loss
ah
do
not
when
my
heart
hath
scaped
this
sorrow
come
in
the
rearward
of
conquered
woe
give
not
windy
night
rainy
morrow
to
linger
out
purposed
overthrow
if
thou
wilt
leave
me
do
not
leave
me
last
when
other
petty
griefs
have
done
their
spite
but
in
the
onset
come
so
shall
taste
at
first
the
very
worst
of
fortune
might
and
other
strains
of
woe
which
now
seem
woe
compared
with
loss
of
thee
will
not
seem
so
some
glory
in
their
birth
some
in
their
skill
some
in
their
wealth
some
in
their
body
force
some
in
their
garments
though
new-fangled
ill
some
in
their
hawks
and
hounds
some
in
their
horse
and
every
humour
hath
his
adjunct
pleasure
wherein
it
finds
joy
above
the
rest
but
these
particulars
are
not
my
measure
all
these
better
in
one
general
best
thy
love
is
better
than
high
birth
to
me
richer
than
wealth
prouder
than
garments
costs
of
more
delight
than
hawks
and
horses
be
and
having
thee
of
all
men
pride
boast
wretched
in
this
alone
that
thou
mayst
take
all
this
away
and
me
most
wretchcd
make
but
do
thy
worst
to
steal
thy
self
away
for
term
of
life
thou
art
assured
mine
and
life
no
longer
than
thy
love
will
stay
for
it
depends
upon
that
love
of
thine
then
need
not
to
fear
the
worst
of
wrongs
when
in
the
least
of
them
my
life
hath
end
see
better
state
to
me
belongs
than
that
which
on
thy
humour
doth
depend
thou
canst
not
vex
me
with
inconstant
mind
since
that
my
life
on
thy
revolt
doth
lie
what
happy
title
do
find
happy
to
have
thy
love
happy
to
die
but
what
so
blessed-fair
that
fears
no
blot
thou
mayst
be
false
and
yet
know
it
not
so
shall
live
supposing
thou
art
true
like
deceived
husband
so
love
face
may
still
seem
love
to
me
though
altered
new
thy
looks
with
me
thy
heart
in
other
place
for
there
can
live
no
hatred
in
thine
eye
therefore
in
that
cannot
know
thy
change
in
many
looks
the
false
heart
history
is
writ
in
moods
and
frowns
and
wrinkles
strange
but
heaven
in
thy
creation
did
decree
that
in
thy
face
sweet
love
should
ever
dwell
whate
er
thy
thoughts
or
thy
heart
workings
be
thy
looks
should
nothing
thence
but
sweetness
tell
how
like
eve
apple
doth
thy
beauty
grow
if
thy
sweet
virtue
answer
not
thy
show
they
that
have
power
to
hurt
and
will
do
none
that
do
not
do
the
thing
they
most
do
show
who
moving
others
are
themselves
as
stone
unmoved
cold
and
to
temptation
slow
they
rightly
do
inherit
heaven
graces
and
husband
nature
riches
from
expense
tibey
are
the
lords
and
owners
of
their
faces
others
but
stewards
of
their
excellence
the
summer
flower
is
to
the
summer
sweet
though
to
it
self
it
only
live
and
die
but
if
that
flower
with
base
infection
meet
the
basest
weed
outbraves
his
dignity
for
sweetest
things
turn
sourest
by
their
deeds
lilies
that
fester
smell
far
worse
than
weeds
how
sweet
and
lovely
dost
thou
make
the
shame
which
like
canker
in
the
fragrant
rose
doth
spot
the
beauty
of
thy
budding
name
in
what
sweets
dost
thou
thy
sins
enclose
that
tongue
that
tells
the
story
of
thy
days
making
lascivious
comments
on
thy
sport
cannot
dispraise
but
in
kind
of
praise
naming
thy
name
blesses
an
ill
report
what
mansion
have
those
vices
got
which
for
their
habitation
chose
out
thee
where
beauty
veil
doth
cover
every
blot
and
all
things
turns
to
fair
that
eyes
can
see
take
heed
dear
heart
of
this
large
privilege
the
hardest
knife
ill-used
doth
lose
his
edge
some
say
thy
fault
is
youth
some
wantonness
some
say
thy
grace
is
youth
and
gentle
sport
both
grace
and
faults
are
loved
of
more
and
less
thou
mak
faults
graces
that
to
thee
resort
as
on
the
finger
of
throned
queen
the
basest
jewel
will
be
well
esteemed
so
are
those
errors
that
in
thee
are
seen
to
truths
translated
and
for
true
things
deemed
how
many
lambs
might
the
stern
wolf
betray
if
like
lamb
he
could
his
looks
translate
how
many
gazers
mightst
thou
lead
away
if
thou
wouldst
use
the
strength
of
all
thy
state
but
do
not
so
love
thee
in
such
sort
as
thou
being
mine
mine
is
thy
good
report
how
like
winter
hath
my
absence
been
from
thee
the
pleasure
of
the
fleeting
year
what
freezings
have
felt
what
dark
days
seen
what
old
december
bareness
everywhere
and
yet
this
time
removed
was
summer
time
the
teeming
autumn
big
with
rich
increase
bearing
the
wanton
burden
of
the
prime
like
widowed
wombs
after
their
lords
decease
yet
this
abundant
issue
seemed
to
me
but
hope
of
orphans
and
unfathered
fruit
for
summer
and
his
pleasures
wait
on
thee
and
thou
away
the
very
birds
are
mute
or
if
they
sing
tis
with
so
dull
cheer
that
leaves
look
pale
dreading
the
winter
near
from
you
have
been
absent
in
the
spring
when
proud-pied
april
dressed
in
all
his
trim
hath
put
spirit
of
youth
in
every
thing
that
heavy
saturn
laughed
and
leaped
with
him
yet
nor
the
lays
of
birds
nor
the
sweet
smell
of
different
flowers
in
odour
and
in
hue
could
make
me
any
summer
story
tell
or
from
their
proud
lap
pluck
them
where
they
grew
nor
did
wonder
at
the
lily
white
nor
praise
the
deep
vermilion
in
the
rose
they
were
but
sweet
but
figures
of
delight
drawn
after
you
you
pattern
of
all
those
yet
seemed
it
winter
still
and
you
away
as
with
your
shadow
with
these
did
play
the
forward
violet
thus
did
chide
sweet
thief
whence
didst
thou
steal
thy
sweet
that
smells
if
not
from
my
love
breath
the
purple
pride
which
on
thy
soft
check
for
complexion
dwells
in
my
love
veins
thou
hast
too
grossly
dyed
the
lily
condemned
for
thy
hand
and
buds
of
marjoram
had
stol
thy
hair
the
roses
fearfully
on
thorns
did
stand
one
blushing
shame
another
white
despair
third
nor
red
nor
white
had
stol
of
both
and
to
his
robbery
had
annexed
thy
breath
but
for
his
theft
in
pride
of
all
his
growth
vengeful
canker
eat
him
up
to
death
more
flowers
noted
yet
none
could
see
but
sweet
or
colour
it
had
stol
from
thee
where
art
thou
muse
that
thou
forget
so
long
to
speak
of
that
which
gives
thee
all
thy
might
spend
thou
thy
fury
on
some
worthless
song
darkening
thy
power
to
lend
base
subjects
light
return
forgetful
muse
and
straight
redeem
in
gentle
numbers
time
so
idly
spent
sing
to
the
ear
that
doth
thy
lays
esteem
and
gives
thy
pen
both
skill
and
argument
rise
resty
muse
my
love
sweet
face
survey
if
time
have
any
wrinkle
graven
there
if
any
be
satire
to
decay
and
make
time
spoils
despised
everywhere
give
my
love
fame
faster
than
time
wastes
life
so
thou
prevent
his
scythe
and
crooked
knife
truant
muse
what
shall
be
thy
amends
for
thy
neglect
of
truth
in
beauty
dyed
both
truth
and
beauty
on
my
love
depends
so
dost
thou
too
and
therein
dignified
make
answer
muse
wilt
thou
not
haply
say
truth
needs
no
colour
with
his
colour
fixed
beauty
no
pencil
beauty
truth
to
lay
but
best
is
best
if
never
intermixed
because
he
needs
no
praise
wilt
thou
be
dumb
excuse
not
silence
so
fort
lies
in
thee
to
make
him
much
outlive
gilded
tomb
and
to
be
praised
of
ages
yet
to
be
then
do
thy
office
muse
teach
thee
how
to
make
him
seem
long
hence
as
he
shows
now
my
love
is
strengthened
though
more
weak
in
seeming
love
not
less
though
less
the
show
appear
that
love
is
merchandized
whose
rich
esteeming
the
owner
tongue
doth
publish
every
where
our
love
was
new
and
then
but
in
the
spring
when
was
wont
to
greet
it
with
my
lays
as
philomel
in
summer
front
doth
sing
and
stops
her
pipe
in
growth
of
riper
days
not
that
the
summer
is
less
pleasant
now
than
when
her
mournful
hymns
did
hush
the
night
but
that
wild
music
burthens
every
bough
and
sweets
grown
common
lose
their
dear
delight
therefore
like
her
sometime
hold
my
tongue
because
would
not
dull
you
with
my
song
alack
what
poverty
my
muse
brings
forth
that
having
such
scope
to
show
her
pride
the
argument
all
bare
is
of
more
worth
than
when
it
hath
my
added
praise
beside
blame
me
not
if
no
more
can
write
look
in
your
glass
and
there
appears
face
that
over-goes
my
blunt
invention
quite
dulling
my
lines
and
doing
me
disgrace
were
it
not
sinful
then
striving
to
mend
to
mar
the
subject
that
before
was
well
for
to
no
other
pass
my
verses
tend
than
of
your
graces
and
your
gifts
to
tell
and
more
much
more
than
in
my
verse
can
sit
your
own
glass
shows
you
when
you
look
in
it
to
me
fair
friend
you
never
can
be
old
for
as
you
were
when
first
your
eye
eyed
such
seems
your
beauty
still
three
winters
cold
have
from
the
forests
shook
three
summers
pride
three
beauteous
springs
to
yellow
autumn
turned
in
process
of
the
seasons
have
seen
three
april
perfumes
in
three
hot
junes
burned
since
first
saw
you
fresh
which
yet
are
green
ah
yet
doth
beauty
like
dial
hand
steal
from
his
figure
and
no
pace
perceived
so
your
sweet
hue
which
methinks
still
doth
stand
hath
motion
and
mine
eye
may
be
deceived
for
fear
of
which
hear
this
thou
age
unbred
ere
you
were
born
was
beauty
summer
dead
let
not
my
love
be
called
idolatry
nor
my
beloved
as
an
idol
show
since
all
alike
my
songs
and
praises
be
to
one
of
one
still
such
and
ever
so
kind
is
my
love
to-day
to-morrow
kind
still
constant
in
wondrous
excellence
therefore
my
verse
to
constancy
confined
one
thing
expressing
leaves
out
difference
fair
kind
and
true
is
all
my
argument
fair
kind
and
true
varying
to
other
words
and
in
this
change
is
my
invention
spent
three
themes
in
one
which
wondrous
scope
affords
fair
kind
and
true
have
often
lived
alone
which
three
till
now
never
kept
seat
in
one
when
in
the
chronicle
of
wasted
time
see
descriptions
of
the
fairest
wights
and
beauty
making
beautiful
old
rhyme
in
praise
of
ladies
dead
and
lovely
knights
then
in
the
blazon
of
sweet
beauty
best
of
hand
of
foot
of
lip
of
eye
of
brow
see
their
antique
pen
would
have
expressed
even
such
beauty
as
you
master
now
so
all
their
praises
are
but
prophecies
of
this
our
time
all
you
prefiguring
and
for
they
looked
but
with
divining
eyes
they
had
not
skill
enough
your
worth
to
sing
for
we
which
now
behold
these
present
days
have
eyes
to
wonder
but
lack
tongues
to
praise
not
mine
own
fears
nor
the
prophetic
soul
of
the
wide
world
dreaming
on
things
to
come
can
yet
the
lease
of
my
true
love
control
supposed
as
forfeit
to
confined
doom
the
mortal
moon
hath
her
eclipse
endured
and
the
sad
augurs
mock
their
own
presage
incertainties
now
crown
themselves
assured
and
peace
proclaims
olives
of
endless
age
now
with
the
drops
of
this
most
balmy
time
my
love
looks
fresh
and
death
to
me
subscribes
since
spite
of
him
ll
live
in
this
poor
rhyme
while
he
insults
er
dull
and
speechless
tribes
and
thou
in
this
shalt
find
thy
monument
when
tyrants
crests
and
tombs
of
brass
are
spent
what
in
the
brain
that
ink
may
character
which
hath
not
figured
to
thee
my
true
spirit
what
new
to
speak
what
now
to
register
that
may
express
my
love
or
thy
dear
merit
nothing
sweet
boy
but
yet
like
prayers
divine
must
each
day
say
er
the
very
same
counting
no
old
thing
old
thou
mine
thine
even
as
when
first
hallowed
thy
fair
name
so
that
eternal
love
in
love
fresh
case
weighs
not
the
dust
and
injury
of
age
nor
gives
to
necessary
wrinkles
place
but
makes
antiquity
for
aye
his
page
finding
the
first
conceit
of
love
there
bred
where
time
and
outward
form
would
show
it
dead
never
say
that
was
false
of
heart
though
absence
seemed
my
flame
to
qualify
as
easy
might
from
my
self
depart
as
from
my
soul
which
in
thy
breast
doth
lie
that
is
my
home
of
love
if
have
ranged
like
him
that
travels
return
again
just
to
the
time
not
with
the
time
exchanged
so
that
my
self
bring
water
for
my
stain
never
believe
though
in
my
nature
reigned
all
frailties
that
besiege
all
kinds
of
blood
that
it
could
so
preposterously
be
stained
to
leave
for
nothing
all
thy
sum
of
good
for
nothing
this
wide
universe
call
save
thou
my
rose
in
it
thou
art
my
all
alas
tis
true
have
gone
here
and
there
and
made
my
self
motley
to
the
view
gored
mine
own
thoughts
sold
cheap
what
is
most
dear
made
old
offences
of
affections
new
most
true
it
is
that
have
looked
on
truth
askance
and
strangely
but
by
all
above
these
blenches
gave
my
heart
another
youth
and
worse
essays
proved
thee
my
best
of
love
now
all
is
done
have
what
shall
have
no
end
mine
appetite
never
more
will
grind
on
newer
proof
to
try
an
older
friend
god
in
love
to
whom
am
confined
then
give
me
welcome
next
my
heaven
the
best
even
to
thy
pure
and
most
most
loving
breast
for
my
sake
do
you
with
fortune
chide
the
guilty
goddess
of
my
harmful
deeds
that
did
not
better
for
my
life
provide
than
public
means
which
public
manners
breeds
thence
comes
it
that
my
name
receives
brand
and
almost
thence
my
nature
is
subdued
to
what
it
works
in
like
the
dyer
hand
pity
me
then
and
wish
were
renewed
whilst
like
willing
patient
will
drink
potions
of
eisel
gainst
my
strong
infection
no
bitterness
that
will
bitter
think
nor
double
penance
to
correct
correction
pity
me
then
dear
friend
and
assure
ye
even
that
your
pity
is
enough
to
cure
me
your
love
and
pity
doth
th
impression
fill
which
vulgar
scandal
stamped
upon
my

for
what

who
calls
me
well

ill
so
you
er-green
my
bad
my

allow
you
are
my

must
strive

know
my
shames

from

how
with

do
dispense
you

so
strongly
in
my
purpose
bred
that
all
the
world
besides
methinks
are
dead
since
left
you
mine
eye
is
in
my
mind
and
that
which
governs
me
to
go
about
doth
part
his
function
and
is
partly
blind
seems
seeing
but
effectually
is
out
for
it
no
form
delivers
to
the
heart
of
bird
of

what
with
his
gust
is
greeing
and
to
his

prepare
the
cup

begin
those
lines
that
before
have
writ

lie
even

that
said

not

sick
of

what

of

tears
distilled
from

foul
as

applying

committed
whilst

never
how

return
rebuked

thrice

than
have
spent
that
you
were

unkind
befriends
me
now
and
for
that
sorrow
which
then
did
feel
needs
must
under
my
transgression
bow
unless
my
nerves
were
brass

hammered
steel
for
if
you
were
by
my
unkindness
shaken
as
by
yours
have
passed
hell
of
time
and
tyrant
have
no
leisure
taken
to
weigh
how
once
suffered
in
your
crime
that
our
night
of
woe
might
have
remembered
my
deepest
sense
how
hard
true
sorrow
hits
and
soon
to
you
as
you
to
me
then
tendered
the
humble
salve
which
wounded
bosoms
fits
but
that
your
trespass
now
becomes
fee
mine
ransoms
yours
and
yours
must
ransom
me
tis
better
to
be
vile
than
vile
esteemed
when
not
to
be
receives
reproach
of
being
and
the
just
pleasure
lost
which
is
so
deemed
not
by
our
feeling
but
by
others
seeing
for
why
should
others
false
adulterate
eyes
give
salutation
to
my
sportive
blood
or
on
my
frailties
why
are
frailer
spies
which
in
their

count
bad
what
think
good
no
am
that

up

by
their

thoughts
my

must
not
be
shown

this
general
evil
they
maintain
all
men
are
bad
and
in
their
badness
reign
thy
gift
thy
tables
are
within
my
brain
full
charactered
with
lasting
memory
which
shall
above
that
idle
rank
remain
beyond

at

she

her

is
to
render
thee
in
the
old
age
black
was
not
counted
fair
or
if
it
were
it
bore
not
beauty
name
but
now
is
black
beauty
successive
heir
and
beauty
slandered
with
bastard
shame
for
since
each
hand
hath
put
on

power
fairing
the
foul
with

false
borrowed
face
sweet
beauty
hath
no
name
no
holy
bower
but
is
profaned
if
not
lives
in
disgrace
therefore
my
mistress
eyes
are
raven
black
her
eyes
so
suited
and
they
mourners
seem
at
such
who
not
born
fair
no
beauty
lack
slandering
creation
with
false
esteem
yet
so
they
mourn
becoming
of
their
woe
that
every
tongue
says
beauty
should
look
so
how
oft
when
thou
my
music
music
play
upon
that
blessed
wood
whose
motion
sounds
with
thy
sweet
fingers
when
thou
gently
sway
the
wiry
concord
that
mine
ear
confounds
do
envy
those
jacks
that
nimble
leap
to
kiss
the
tender
inward
of
thy
hand
whilst
my
poor
lips
which
should
that
harvest
reap
at
the
wood
boldness
by
thee
blushing
stand
to
be
so
tickled
they
would
change
their
state
and
situation
with
those
dancing
chips
er
whom
thy
fingers
walk
with
gentle
gait
making
dead
wood
more
blest
than
living
lips
since
saucy
jacks
so
happy
are
in
this
give
them
thy
fingers
me
thy
lips
to
kiss
th
expense
of
spirit
in
waste
of

is

my

eyes
are
nothing

coral
is

my

thou

as
thou

dare
not

although
swear
it
to
my

and
to

that
is
not

swear
thousand
groans
but
thinking
on
thy

one
on
another
neck
do
witness
bear
thy
black
is
fairest
in
my
judgment
place
in
nothing
art
thou
black
save
in
thy

and
thence
this
slander
as
think
proceeds
thine

and
they
as
pitying
me
knowing
thy

torment
me
with
disdain
have
put
on
black
and
loving

be

and
truly
not
the

as
those

let
it
then

beseem
thy

to
mourn
for
me
since
mourning
doth
thee
grace
and
suit
thy
pity
like
in
every

then
will
swear
beauty
herself
is
black
and
all
they
foul
that
thy

lack
beshrew
that

that
makes
my
heart
to
groan
for
that
deep
wound
it
gives
my

and
me
ist
not

to
torture
me

but
slave
to
slavery
my

must
be
me
from
my

thy
cruel
eye

my

self
thou
harder

thee
am
forsaken
torment
thrice
three-fold
thus
to

then
my

thou
canst
not

and
yet
thou
wilt
for
being
pent
in

perforce
am
thine
and
all
that
is

so
now
have
confessed
that
he

that

but
thou

for
thou

and
he
is

surety-like
to

under

that
him

whoever

thou
hast
thy

in
over-plus
more

am
that
vex

still
to

thus
wilt
thou

not

no

shine
the
sea
all
water

so
thou

add
to
thy

more
let
no

no

beseechers
kill
think
all
but
one
and
me
in
that
one

if
thy

check
thee
that
come
so
near
swear
to
thy
blind
soul
that
was
thy

and
will
thy
soul
knows
is
admitted
there
thus
far
for
love
my
love-suit
sweet
fulfil
will
will
fulfil
the
treasure
of
thy

ay
fill
it
full
with
wills
and
my
will
one
in
things
of
great
receipt
with
case
we
prove
among
number
one
is
reckoned
none
then
in
the
number
let
me
pass
untold
though
in
thy

account
one
must
be
for
nothing
hold
me
so
it
please
thee
hold
that
nothing
me
something
sweet
to
thee
make
but
my
name
thy
love
and
love
that
still
and
then
thou
lov
me
for
my
name
is
will
thou
blind
fool
love
what
dost
thou
to
mine
eyes
that
they
behold
and
see
not
what
they
see
they
know
what
beauty
is
see
where
it
lies
yet
what
the
best
is
take
the
worst
to
be
if
eyes
corrupt
by
over-partial
looks
be
anchored
in
the
bay
where
all
men
ride
why
of
eyes
falsehood
hast
thou
forged
hooks
whereto
the
judgment
of
my
heart
is
tied
why
should
my
heart
think
that
several
plot
which
my
heart
knows
the
wide
world
common
place
or
mine
eyes
seeing
this
say
this
is
not
to
put
fair
truth
upon
so
foul
face
in
things
right
true
my
heart
and
eyes
have
erred
and
to
this
false
plague
are
they
now
transferred
when
my
love
swears
that
she
is
made
of
truth
do
believe
her
though
know
she
lies
that
she
might
think
me
some
untutored
youth
unlearned
in
the
world
false
subtleties
thus
vainly
thinking
that
she
thinks
me
young
although
she
knows
my
days
are
past
the
best
simply
credit
her
false-speaking
tongue
on
both
sides
thus
is
simple
truth
suppressed
but
wherefore
says
she
not
she
is
unjust
and
wherefore
say
not
that
am
old
love
best
habit
is
in
seeming
trust
and
age
in
love
loves
not
to
have
years
told
therefore
lie
with
her
and
she
with
me
and
in
our
faults
by
lies
we
flattered
be
call
not
me
to
justify
the
wrong
that
thy
unkindness
lays
upon
my
heart
wound
me
not
with
thine
eye
but
with
thy
tongue
use
power
with
power
and
slay
me
not
by
art
tell
me
thou
lov
elsewhere
but
in
my
sight
dear
heart
forbear
to
glance
thine
eye
aside
what
need
thou
wound
with
cunning
when
thy
might
is
more
than
my
erpressed
defence
can
bide
let
me
excuse
thee
ah
my
love
well
knows
her
pretty
looks
have
been
mine
enemies
and
therefore
from
my
face
she
turns
my
foes
that
they
elsewhere
might
dart
their
injuries
yet
do
not
so
but
since
am
near
slain
kill
me
outright
with
looks
and
rid
my
pain
be
wise
as
thou
art
cruel
do
not
press
my
tongue-tied
patience
with
too
much
disdain
lest
sorrow
lend
me
words
and
words
express
the
manner
of
my
pity-wanting
pain
if
might
teach
thee
wit
better
it
were
though
not
to
love
yet
love
to
tell
me
so
as
testy
sick
men
when
their
deaths
be
near
no
news
but
health
from
their
physicians
know
for
if
should
despair
should
grow
mad
and
in
my
madness
might
speak
ill
of
thee
now
this
ill-wresting
world
is
grown
so
bad
mad
slanderers
by
mad
ears
believed
be
that
may
not
be
so
nor
thou
belied
bear
thine
eyes
straight
though
thy
proud
heart
go
wide
in
faith
do
not
love
thee
with
mine
eyes
for
they
in
thee
thousand
errors
note
but
tis
my
heart
that
loves
what
they
despise
who
in
despite
of
view
is
pleased
to
dote
nor
are
mine
cars
with
thy
tongue
tune
delighted
nor
tender
feeling
to
base
touches
prone
nor
taste
nor
smell
desire
to
be
invited
to
any
sensual
feast
with
thee
alone
but
my
five
wits
nor
my
five
senses
can
dissuade
one
foolish
heart
from
serving
thee
who
leaves
unswayed
the
likeness
of
man
thy
proud
heart
slave
and
vassal
wretch
to
be
only
my
plague
thus
far
count
my
gain
that
she
that
makes
me
sin
awards
me
pain
love
is
my
sin
and
thy
dear
virtue
hate
hate
of
my
sin
grounded
on
sinful
loving
but
with
mine
compare
thou
thine
own
state
and
thou
shalt
find
it
merits
not
reproving
or
if
it
do
not
from
those
lips
of
thine
that
have
profaned
their
scarlet
ornaments
and
sealed
false
bonds
of
love
as
oft
as
mine
robbed
others
beds
revenues
of
their
rents
be
it
lawful
love
thee
as
thou
lov
those
whom
thine
eyes
woo
as
mine
importune
thee
root
pity
in
thy
heart
that
when
it
grows
thy
pity
may
deserve
to
pitied
be
if
thou
dost
seek
to
have
what
thou
dost
hide
by
self-example
mayst
thou
be
denied
lo
as
careful
huswife
runs
to
catch
one
of
her
feathered
creatures
broke
away
sets
down
her
babe
and
makes
all
swift
dispatch
in
pursuit
of
the
thing
she
would
have
stay
whilst
her
neglected
child
holds
her
in
chase
cries
to
catch
her
whose
busy
care
is
bent
to
follow
that
which
flies
before
her
face
not
prizing
her
poor
infant
discontent
so
run
thou
after
that
which
flies
from
thee
whilst
thy
babe
chase
thee
afar
behind
but
if
thou
catch
thy
hope
turn
back
to
me
and
play
the
mother
part
kiss
me
be
kind
so
will
pray
that
thou
mayst
have
thy
will
if
thou
turn
back
and
my
loud
crying
still
two
loves
have
of
comfort
and
despair
which
like
two
spirits
do
suggest
me
still
the
better
angel
is
man
right
fair
the
worser
spirit
woman
coloured
ill
to
win
me
soon
to
hell
my
female
evil
tempteth
my
better
angel
from
my
side
and
would
corrupt
my
saint
to
be
devil
wooing
his
purity
with
her
foul
pride
and
whether
that
my
angel
be
turned
fiend
suspect
may
yet
not
directly
tell
but
being
both
from
me
both
to
each
friend
guess
one
angel
in
another
hell
yet
this
shall
ne
er
know
but
live
in
doubt
till
my
bad
angel
fire
my
good
one
out
those
lips
that
love
own
hand
did
make
breathed
forth
the
sound
that
said
hate
to
me
that
languished
for
her
sake
but
when
she
saw
my
woeful
state
straight
in
her
heart
did
mercy
come
chiding
that
tongue
that
ever
sweet
was
used
in
giving
gentle
doom
and
taught
it
thus
anew
to
greet
hate
she
altered
with
an
end
that
followed
it
as
gentle
day
doth
follow
night
who
like
fiend
from
heaven
to
hell
is
flown
away
hate
from
hate
away
she
threw
and
saved
my
life
saying
not
you
poor
soul
the
centre
of
my
sinful
earth
my
sinful
earth
these
rebel
powers
array
why
dost
thou
pine
within
and
suffer
dearth
painting
thy
outward
walls
so
costly
gay
why
so
large
cost
having
so
short
lease
dost
thou
upon
thy
fading
mansion
spend
shall
worms
inheritors
of
this
excess
eat
up
thy

it

there
little

in

against
the
rule
of

to

is
to
accuse
your

which
is
most
infallible
disobedience
he
that

virgin
virginity
murders

should

breeds
mites
much
like

consumes
itself
to

very
paring

so
dies
with
feeding
his

besides
virginity
is
peevish
proud
idle
made

yes
my

she

poor

my

disdain
rather
corrupt
me
ever

tis
only
title
thou
disdain
in

the
which

strange
is
it
that
our

of
colour
weight
and
heat
pour
all
together
would
quite
confound
distinction
yet
stand
off
in
differences
so
mighty
if
she
be
all
that
is
virtuous-save
what
thou
dislik
poor
physician
daughter-thou
dislik
of
virtue
for
the
name
but
do
not
so
from
lowest
place
when
virtuous
things
proceed
the
place
is
dignified
by
the
doer
deed
where
great
additions
swell
and
virtue
none
it
is
dropsied
honour
good
alone
is
good
without
name
vileness
is
so
the
property
by
what
it
is
should
go
not
by
the
title
she
is
young
wise
fair
in
these
to
nature
she
immediate
heir
and
these
breed
honour
that
is
honour
scorn
which
challenges
itself
as
honour
born
and
is
not
like
the

honours
thrive
when
rather
from
our
acts
we
them
derive
than
our
fore-goers
the
mere

slave
debauch
on
every
tomb
on
every

lying

and
as
oft
is
dumb
where

oblivion
is
the

of

indeed
what
should
be
said
if
thou
canst

as

create
the

she
is
her

from

bertram
cannot

to

an

that

he

excellent
command

to
rend
our
own
soldiers
first
lord
that
was
not
to
be
blam
in
the

it
was
disaster
of

that
caesar
himself
could
not
have
prevented
if
he
had
been
there
to
command
bertram
well
we
cannot
greatly
condemn
our
success
some
dishonour
we
had
in
the
loss
of
that
drum
but
it
is
not
to
be
recovered

it
might
have

it

it

that
the

attributed

have
that

when

when
you
sally
upon

speak
what
terrible

you
will
though
you
understand
it
not
yourselves
no

second

he
must
think
us
some

entertainment
now
he
hath

not

we

but
fair
soul
in
your
fine
frame
hath
love
no
quality
if
the
quick
fire
of
youth
light
not
your
mind
you
are
no
maiden
but
monument
when
you
are
dead
you
should
be
such
one
as
you
are
now
for
you
are
cold
and
stern
and
now
you
should
be
as
your

was
when
your
sweet

was
got

she
then
was
honest
bertram
so
should
you
be
diana
no
my

did
but
duty
such
my

as
you
owe
to
your

bertram
no
more
ot

prithee
do
not
strive

for
ever
do
thee
all
rights
of

diana
ay
so
you
serve

till

when

barely
leave
our
thorns
to
prick
ourselves
and
mock
us
with
our
bareness
bertram
how
have
sworn
diana
tis
not
the
many
oaths
that

the
truth
but
the
plain
single
vow
that
is
vow
true
what
is
not
holy
that
we
swear
not
by

take
the
high
to

then
pray

tell
me
if

by
jove
great
attributes
lov
you
dearly
would
you
believe
my
oaths
when
did

you
ill
this
has
no
holding
to
swear
by
him
whom
protest
to
love
that
will
work
against
him
therefore
your
oaths
are
words
and
poor
conditions
but
unseal
dat
least
in
my
opinion
bertram

they
are
greater
storms

little
should
say
myself
offended
and
with
you
chiefly
the
world
more
laugh
at
that
should
once
name
you
derogately
when
to
sound
your
name
it
not
concern
me
antony
my
being
in
egypt
caesar
what
wast
to
you
caesar
no
more
than
my
residing
here
at
rome
might
be
to
you
in
egypt
yet
if
you
there
did
practise
on
my
state
your
being
in
egypt
might
be
my
question
antony
how
intend
you
practis
caesar
you
may
be
pleas
to
catch
at
mine
intent
by
what
did
here
befall
me
your
wife
and
brother
made
wars
upon
me
and
their
contestation
was
theme
for
you
you
were
the
word
of
war
antony
you
do
mistake
your
business
my
brother
never
did
urge
me
in
his
act
did
inquire
it
and
have
my
learning
from
some
true
reports
that
drew
their
swords
with
you
did
he
not
rather
discredit
my
authority
with
yours
and
make
the
wars
alike
against
my
stomach
having
alike
your
cause
of
this
my
letters
before
did
satisfy
you
if
you
ll
patch
quarrel
as
matter
whole
you
have
not
to
make
it
with
it
must
not
be
with
this
caesar
you
praise
yourself
by
laying
defects
of
judgment
to
me
but
you
patch
up
your
excuses
antony
not
so
not
so
know
you
could
not
lack
am
certain
ont
very
necessity
of
this
thought
that
your
partner
in
the
cause
gainst
which
he
fought
could
not
with
graceful
eyes
attend
those
wars
which
fronted
mine
own
peace
as
for
my
wife
would
you
had
her
spirit
in
such
another
the
third
th
world
is
yours
which
with
snaffle
you
may
pace
easy
but
not
such
wife
enobarbus
would
we
had
all
such
wives
that
the
men
might
go
to
wars
with
the
women
antony
so
much
uncurbable
her
garboils
caesar
made
out
of
her
impatience
which
not
wanted
shrewdness
of
policy
too
grieving
grant
did
you
too
much
disquiet
for
that
you
must
but
say
could
not
help
it
caesar
wrote
to
you
when
rioting
in
alexandria
you
did
pocket
up
my
letters
and
with
taunts
did
gibe
my
missive
out
of
audience
antony
sir
he
fell
upon
me
ere
admitted
then
three
kings
had
newly
feasted
and
did
want
of
what
was
th
morning
but
next
day
told
him
of
myself
which
was
as
much
as
to
have
ask
him
pardon
let
this
fellow
be
nothing
of
our
strife
if
we
contend
out
of
our
question
wipe
him
caesar
you
have
broken
the
article
of
your
oath
which
you
shall
never
have
tongue
to
charge
me
with
lepidus
soft
caesar
antony
no
lepidus
let
him
speak
the
honour
is
sacred
which
he
talks
on
now
supposing
that
lack
it
but
on
caesar
the
article
of
my
oathcaesar
to
lend
me
arms
and
aid
when
requir
them
the
which
you
both
denied
antony
neglected
rather
and
then
when
poisoned
hours
had
bound
me
up
from
mine
own
knowledge
as
nearly
as
may
ll
play
the
penitent
to
you
but
mine
honesty
shall
not
make
poor
my
greatness
nor
my
power
work
without
it
truth
is
that
fulvia
to
have
me
out
of
egypt
made
wars
here
for
which
myself
the
ignorant
motive
do
so
far
ask
pardon
as
befits
mine
honour
to
stoop
in
such
case
lepidus
tis
noble
spoken
maecenas
if
it
might
please
you
to
enforce
no
further
the
griefs
between
ye
to
forget
them
quite
were
to
remember
that
the
present
need
speaks
to
atone
you
lepidus
worthily
spoken
maecenas
enobarbus
or
if
you
borrow
one
another
love
for
the
instant
you
may
when
you
hear
no
more
words
of
pompey
return
it
again
you
shall
have
time
to
wrangle
in
when
you
have
nothing
else
to
do
antony
thou
art
soldier
only
speak
no
more
enobarbus
that
truth
should
be
silent
had
almost
forgot
antony
you
wrong
this
presence
therefore
speak
no
more
enobarbus
go
to
then
your
considerate
stone
caesar
do
not
much
dislike
the
matter
but
the
manner
of
his

fort
cannot
be

shall
remain
in

diff

if

utter
by

all

enobarbus
ay
sir
we
did
sleep
day
out
of

and
made
the
night
light
with
drinking
maecenas
eight
wild
boars
roasted
whole
at
breakfast
and
but
twelve
persons
there
is
this
true
enobarbus
this
was
but
as
fly
by
an
eagle
we
had
much
more
monstrous
matter
of
feast
which
worthily
deserved
noting
maecenas
she
most
triumphant
lady
if

be
square
to
her
enobarbus
when

first
met
mark

purs
up
his
heart
upon
the
river
of
cydnus
agrippa
there
she
appear
indeed
or
my

devis
well
for
her
enobarbus
will
tell
you
the
barge
she
sat
in
like
burnish
throne
burn
on
the
water
the
poop
was
beaten
gold
purple
the
sails
and
so
perfumed
that
the
winds
were
love-sick
with
them
the
oars
were
silver
which
to
the
tune
of
flutes
kept
stroke
and
made
the
water
which
they
beat
to
follow
faster
as
amorous
of
their
strokes
for
her
own
person
it
beggar
all
description
she
did
lie
in
her
pavilion
cloth-of
gold
of
tissue
erpicturing
that
venus
where
we
see
the
fancy
out-work
nature
on
each
side
her
stood
pretty
dimpled
boys
like
smiling
cupids
with
divers-colour
fans
whose
wind
did
seem
to
glow
the
delicate
cheeks
which
they
did
cool
and
what
they
undid
did
agrippa
rare
for
antony
enobarbus
her
gentlewomen
like
the
nereides
so
many
mermaids
tended
her
th
eyes
and
made
their
bends
adornings
at
the
helm
seeming
mermaid
steers
the
silken
tackle
swell
with
the
touches
of
those
flower-soft
hands
that
yarely
frame
the
office
from
the
barge
strange
invisible
perfume
hits
the
sense
of
the
adjacent
wharfs
the
city
cast
her
people
out
upon
her
and
antony
enthron
th
market-place
did
sit
alone
whistling
to
th
air
which
but
for
vacancy
had
gone
to
gaze
on
cleopatra
too
and
made
gap
in

having

she
spoke

panted
that
she

you
have
heard
much
pompey
have
fair
meanings
sir
antony
and
fair
words
to
them
pompey
then
so
much
have
heard
and
have
heard
apollodorus
carriedenobarbus
no
more
of
that
he
did
so
pompey
what
pray
you
enobarbus
certain
queen
to
caesar
in

pompey
know
thee

thee
have
seen
thee

when
have
envied
thy
behaviour
enobarbus
sir
never
lov
you
much
but
ha
prais
ye
when
you
have
well
deserv
ten
times
as
much
as

enjoy
thy
plainness
it
nothing
ill
becomes
thee
aboard
my
galley
invite
you
all
will
you
lead

all
show
the
way
sir
pompey
come

all
but
enobarbus
and
menas
menas
aside
thy
father
pompey
would
ne
er
have
made
this
treaty
you
and
have
known
sir
enobarbus
at
sea
think
menas
we
have
sir
enobarbus
you
have
done
well
by
water
menas
and
you
by
land
enobarbus
will
praise
any
man
that
will
praise
me
though
it
cannot
be
denied
what
have
done
by
land
menas
nor
what
have
done
by
water
enobarbus
yes
something
you
can
deny
for
your
own
safety
you
have
been
great
thief
by
sea
menas
and
you
by
land
enobarbus
there
deny
my
land
service
but
give
me
your
hand
menas
if
our
eyes
had
authority
here
they
might
take
two
thieves
kissing
menas
all
men
faces
are
true
whatsome
er
their
hands
are
enobarbus
but
there
is
never
fair
woman
has
true
face
menas
no
slander
they
steal
hearts
enobarbus
we
came
hither
to
fight
with
you
menas
for
my
part
am
sorry
it
is
turn
to
drinking
pompey
doth
this
day
laugh
away
his
fortune
enobarbus
if
he
do
sure
he
cannot
weept
back
again
menas
have
said
sir
we
look
not
for
mark
antony
here
pray
you
is
he
married
to
cleopatra
enobarbus
caesar
sister
is
call
octavia
menas
true
sir
she
was
the
wife
of
caius
marcellus
enobarbus
but
she
is
now
the
wife
of
marcus
antonius
menas
pray
ye
sir
enobarbus
tis
true
menas
then
is
caesar
and
he
for
ever
knit
together
enobarbus
if
were
bound
to
divine
of
this
unity
would
not
prophesy
so
menas
think
the
policy
of
that
purpose
made
more
in
the
marriage
than
the
love
of
the
parties
enobarbus
think
so
too
but
you
shall
find
the
band
that
seems
to
tie
their
friendship
together
will
be
the
very
strangler
of
their
amity
octavia
is
of
holy
cold
and
still
conversation
menas
who
would
not
have
his
wife
so
enobarbus
not
he
that
himself
is
not
so
which
is
mark
antony
he
will
to
his
egyptian
dish
again
then
shall
the
sighs
of
octavia
blow
the
fire
up
in
caesar
and
as
said
before
that
which
is
the
strength
of
their
amity
shall
prove
the
immediate
author
of
their
variance
antony
will
use
his
affection
where
it
is
he
married
but
his
occasion
here
menas
and
thus
it
may
be
come
sir
will
you

caesar
will
thyreus
hear
it
apart
cleopatra
none
but
friends
say
boldly
thyreus
so
haply
are
they
friends
to
antony
enobarbus
he
needs
as
many
sir
as
caesar
has
or
needs
not
us
if

please
our

will
leap
to
be
his
friend
for
us
you
know
whose
he
is
we
are
and
that
is
caesar
thyreus
so
thus
then
thou
most
renown
caesar
entreats
not
to
consider
in
what
case
thou
stand
further
than
he
is
caesar
cleopatra
go
on
right
royal
thyreus
he
knows
that
you
embrace
not
antony
as
you
did
love
but
as
you
fear
him
cleopatra
thyreus
the
scars
upon
your
honour
therefore
he
does
pity
as
constrained
blemishes
not
as
deserv
cleopatra
he
is
god
and
knows
what
is
most
right
mine
honour
was
not
yielded
but
conquer
merely
enobarbus
aside
to
be
sure
of
that
will
ask

sir

exit
thyreus
shall
say
to
caesar
what
you
require
of
him
for
he
partly
begs
to
be
desir
to
give
it
much
would
please
him
that
of
his
fortunes
you
should
make
staff
to
lean
upon
but
it
would
warm
his
spirits
to
hear
from
me
you
had
left
antony

put
yourself
under

the
universal

carried
them
careening

staggering
spirals
the

was
tired

lay
stretched
on

he
looked
bloodless
and
wan

grizzled

not
able
to

the
thinness
of

the

filled

now

of

toil
were
draining
it
of
what
was
left
he
said
nothing
of

but
thought
much
in
his
feverish
nights
and
in
the
long
afternoons
when
his
knees
felt
weak

etched
deep
on

but
never
too
close
for
the
old
love
and
the
old
habit
to
force
way
through
she
had
seen
lessening
of
energy
and
spirit
asked
about
it
and
received
the
accustomed
answers
that
came
with
the
quick
brisk
cheeriness
that
now
had
to
be
whipped
up
she
had
never
seen
his
dauntless
belief
in
life
shaken
faith
and
debonair
courage
were
his
message
they
were
still
there
but
the
effort
of
the
unbroken
spirit
to
maintain
them
against
the
body
weakness
was
suddenly
revealed
to
her
and
the
pathos
of
it
caught
at
her
throat
she
leaned
forward
and
passed
her
hand
over
his
hair
her
eyes
on
his
face
in
long
gaze
of
almost
solemn
tenderness
you
re
worn
out
she
said
not
bit
of
it
he
answered
stoutly
you
re
the
most
uncomplimentary
person
know
was
just
thinking
what
hardy
pioneer
become
and
that
the
way
you
dash
me
to
the
ground
she
looked
at
the
silvery
meshes
through
which
her
fingers
were
laced
it
quite
white
and
there
were
lots
of
brown
hairs
left
when
we
started
that
the
emigrant
trail
he
smothered
sigh
and
his
trouble
found
words
it
not
for
old
men
missy
old
scornfully
you
re
fifty-three
that
only
thirty-two
years
older
than
am
when
fifty-three
you
ll
be
eighty-five
then
we
ll
begin
to
talk
about
your
being
old
my
little
susan
fifty-three
he
moved
his
head
so
that
he
could
command
her
face
and
dwell
upon
its
blended
bloom
of
olive
and
clear
rose
with
wrinkles
here
and
here
an
indicating
finger
helped
him
and
gray
hairs
all
round
here
and
thick
eyebrows
and
he
dropped
the
hand
and
his
smile
softened
to
reminiscence
it
was
only
yesterday
you
were
baby
little
fat
crowing
thing
all
creases
and
dimples
your
mother
and
used
to
think
everything
about
you
so
wonderful
that
we
each
secretly
believed
and
we
tell
each
other
so
when
nobody
was
round
that
there
had
been
other
babies
in
the
world
but
never
before
one
like
ours
dont
know
but
what
think
that
yet
silly
old
doctor-man
she
murmured
and
now
my
baby
woman
with
all
of
life
before
her
from
where
you
are
it
seems
as
if
it
was
never
going
to
end
but
when
you
get
where
am
and
begin
to
look
back
you
see
that
it
just
little
journey
over
before
you
ve
got
used
to
the
road
and
struck
your
gait
we
ought
to
have
more
time
the
first
half
just
learning
and
the
second
where
we
put
the
learning
into
practice
and
we
re
busy
over
that
when
we
have
to
go
it
too
short
our
life
going
to
be
long
out
in
california
we
re
going
to
come
into
sort
of
second
childhood
be
perennials
like
those
larkspurs
had
in
the
garden
at
home
they
were
silent
thinking
of
the
garden
behind
the
old
house
in
rochester
with
walks
outlined
by
shells
and
edged
by
long
flower
beds
the
girl
looked
back
on
it
with
detached
interest
as
an
unregretted
feature
of
past
existence
in
which
she
had
once
played
her
part
and
that
was
cut
from
the
present
by
chasm
never
to
be
bridged
the
man
held
it
cherishingly
as
one
of
many
lovely
memories
that
stretched
from
this
river
bank
in
strange
land
back
through
the
years
link
in
the
long
chain
wasnt
it
pretty
she
said
dreamily
with
the
line
of
hollyhocks
against
the
red
brick
wall
and
the
big
bushy
pine
tree
in
the
corner
everything
was
bright
except
that
tree
his
eyes
narrowed
in
wistful
retrospect
it
was
as
if
all
the
shadows
in
the
garden
had
concentrated
there
huddled
together
in
one
place
so
that
the
rest
could
be
full
of
color
and
sunshine
and
when
daddy
john
and
wanted
to
cut
it
down
you
wouldnt
let
us
cried
and
stamped
and
so
of
course
we
gave
it
up
actually
believe
you
had
sentiment
about
that
tree
suppose
had
though
dont
know
exactly
what
you
mean
by
sentiment
loved
it
because
once
had
such
perfect
time
up
there
among
the
branches
the
top
had
been
cut
off
and
ring
of
boughs
was
left
round
the
place
and
it
made
the
most
comfortable
seat
almost
like
cradle
one
day
you
went
to
new
york
and
when
you
came
back
you
brought
me
box
of
candy
do
you
remember
it
burnt
almonds
and
chocolate
drops
with
dog
painted
on
the
cover
well
wanted
to
get
them
at
their
very
best
enjoy
them
as
much
as
could
so
climbed
to
the
seat
in
the
top
of
the
pine
and
ate
them
there
can
remember
distinctly
how
lovely
it
was
they
tasted
better
than
any
candies
ve
ever
had
before
or
since
and
leaned
back
on
the
boughs
rocking
and
eating
and
looking
at
the
clouds
and
feeling
the
wind
swaying
the
trunk
can
shut
my
eyes
and
feel
again
the
sense
of
being
entirely
happy
sort
of
limp
and
forgetful
and
so
contented
dont
know
whether
it
was
only
the
candies
or
combination
of
things
that
were
just
right
that
day
and
never
combined
the
same
way
again
for
tried
it
often
afterwards
with
cake
and
fruit
tart
and
other
candies
but
it
was
no
good
but
couldnt
have
the
tree
cut
down
for
there
was
always
hope
that
might
get
the
combination
right
and
have
that
perfectly
delightful
time
once
more
the
doctor
laughter
echoed
between
the
banks
and
hers
fell
in
with
it
though
she
had
told
her
story
with
the
utmost
sedateness
was
there
ever
such
materialist
he
chuckled
it
all
rose
from
box
of
new
york
candy
and
thought
it
was
sentiment
twenty-one
years
old
and
the
same
baby
only
not
quite
so
fat
well
it
was
the
truth
she
said
defensively
suppose
if
left
the
candy
out
it
would
have
sounded
better
dont
leave
the
candy
out
it
was
the
candy
and
the
truth
that
made
it
all
susan
she
picked
up
stone
and
threw
it
in
the
river
then
as
she
watched
its
splash
doesnt
it
seem
long
ago
when
we
were
in
rochester
we
left
there
in
april
and
this
is
june
yes
short
time
in
weeks
but
some
way
or
other
it
seems
like
ages
when
think
of
it
feel
as
if
it
was
at
the
other
side
of
the
world
and
grown
years
and
years
older
since
we
left
if
go
on
this
way
ll
be
fully
fifty-three
when
we
get
to
california
what
made
you
feel
so
old
dont
exactly
know
dont
think
it
because
we
ve
gone
over
so
much
space
but
that
has
something
to
do
with
it
it
seems
as
if
the
change
was
more
in
me
how
have
you
changed
she
gathered
up
the
loose
stones
near
her
and
dropped
them
from
palm
to
palm
frowning
little
in
an
effort
to
find
words
to
clothe
her
vague
thought
dont
know
that
either
or
cant
express
it
liked
things
there
that
dont
care
for
any
more
they
were
such
babyish
things
and
amounted
to
nothing
but
they
seemed
important
then
now
nothing
seems
important
but
things
that
are
the
things
that
would
be
on
desert
island
and
in
getting
to
think
that
way
in
getting
so
far
from
what
you
once
were
person
seems
to
squeeze
good
many
years
into
few
weeks
she
looked
sideways
at
him
the
stones
dropping
from
slanting
palm
do
you
understand
me
he
nodded
when
was
child
thought
as
child
now
have
put
away
childish
things
is
that
it
yes
exactly
then
you
wouldnt
like
to
go
back
to
the
old
life
she
scattered
the
stones
with
an
impatient
gesture
couldnt
hate
it
wouldnt
squeeze
back
into
the
same
shape
be
all
cramped
and
crowded
up
you
see
every
day
out
here
ve
been
growing
wider
and
wider
she
stretched
her
arms
to
their
length
widening
out
to
fit
these
huge
enormous
places
the
new
life
will
be
wide
enough
for
you
you
ll
grow
like
tree
beautiful
tall
straight
tree
that
has
plenty
of
room
for
its
branches
to
spread
and
plenty
of
sun
and
air
to
nourish
it
there
ll
be
no
crowding
or
cramping
out
there
it
good
to
know
you
ll
be
happy
in
california
in
the
beginning
had
fears
she
picked
up
stone
and
with
its
pointed
edge
drew
lines
on
the
dust
which
seemed
to
interest
her
for
she
followed
them
with
intent
eyes
not
answering
he
waited
for
moment
then
said
with
an
undernote
of
pleading
in
his
voice
you
think
you
will
be
happy
dearie
dont
know
she
stammered
nobody
can
tell
we
re
not
there
yet
can
tell
he
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
to
watch
her
face
she
knew
that
he
expected
to
see
the
maiden
bashful
happiness
upon
it
and
the
difference
between
his
fond
imaginings
and
the
actual
facts
sickened
her
with
an
intolerable
sense
of
deception
she
could
never
tell
him
never
strike
out
of
him
his
glad
conviction
of
her
contentment
we
re
going
back
to
the
golden
age
you
and
and
david
we
ll
live
as
we
want
not
the
way
other
people
want
us
to
when
we
get
to
california
we
ll
build
house
somewhere
by
river
and
we
ll
plant
our
seeds
and
have
vines
growing
over
it
and
garden
in
the
front
and
daddy
john
will
break
julia
spirit
and
harness
her
to
the
plow
then
when
the
house
gets
too
small
houses
have
way
of
doing
that
ll
build
little
cabin
by
the
edge
of
the
river
and
you
and
david
will
have
the
house
to
yourselves
where
the
old
white-headed
doctor
wont
be
in
the
way
he
smiled
for
the
joy
of
his
picture
and
she
turned
her
head
from
him
seeing
the
prospect
through
clouded
eyes
you
ll
never
go
out
of
my
house
she
said
in
low
voice
other
spirits
will
come
into
it
and
fill
it
up
wish
that
anything
might
stop
the
slow
advance
to
this
roseate
future
choked
her
she
sat
with
averted
face
wrestling
with
her
sick
distaste
and
heard
him
say
you
dont
know
how
happy
you
re
going
to
be
my
little
missy
she
could
find
no
answer
and
he
went
on
you
have
everything
for
it
health
and
youth
and
pure
heart
and
david
for
your
mate
she
had
to
speak
now
and
said
with
urgence
trying
to
encourage
herself
since
no
one
else
could
do
it
for
her
but
that
all
in
the
future
long
time
from
now
not
so
very
long
we
ought
to
be
in
california
in
five
or
six
weeks
to
have
the
dreaded
reality
suddenly
brought
so
close
set
at
the
limit
of
few
short
weeks
grimly
waiting
at
definite
point
in
the
distance
made
her
repugnance
break
loose
in
alarmed
words
longer
than
that
she
cried
the
desert
the
hardest
place
and
we
ll
go
slow
very
slow
there
you
sound
as
if
you
wanted
to
go
slow
he
answered
his
smile
indulgently
quizzical
as
completely
shut
away
from
her
in
his
man
ignorance
as
though
no
bond
of
love
and
blood
held
them
together
no
no
of
course
not
she
faltered
but
not
at
all
sure
we
ll
get
through
it
so
easily
making
allowance
for
delays
there
are
always
delays
yes
there
may
be
delays
but
we
ll
hope
to
be
one
of
the
lucky
trains
and
get
through
on
time
she
swallowed
dryly
her
heart
gone
down
too
far
to
be
plucked
up
by
futile
contradition
transcriber
note
contradiction
he
mused
moment
seeking
the
best
method
of
broaching
subject
that
had
been
growing
in
his
mind
for
the
past
week
frankness
seemed
the
most
simple
and
he
said
ve
something
to
suggest
to
you
ve
been
thinking
of
it
since
we
left
the
pass
bridger
is
large
post
they
say
there
are
trains
there
from
all
over
the
west
and
people
of
all
sorts
and
quite
often
there
are
missionaries
missionaries
in
faint
voice
yes
coming
in
and
going
out
to
the
tribes
of
the
northwest
suppose
we
found
one
there
when
we
arrived
he
stopped
watching
her
well
her
eyes
slanted
sideways
in
fixity
of
attention
would
you
marry
david
then
we
could
all
go
on
together
her
breath
left
her
and
she
turned
frightened
face
on
him
why
she
gasped
what
for
he
laid
his
hand
on
hers
and
said
quietly
because
as
you
say
the
hardest
part
of
the
journey
is
yet
to
come
and
am
well
not
strong
man
any
more
the
trip
hasnt
done
for
me
what
hoped
if
by
some
mischance
if
anything
should
happen
to
me
then
know
you
be
taken
care
of
protected
and
watched
over
by
some
one
who
could
be
trusted
whose
right
it
was
to
do
that
oh
no
oh
no
she
cried
in
piercing
note
of
protest
couldnt
couldnt
she
made
as
if
to
rise
then
sank
back
drawn
down
by
his
grasping
hand
he
thought
her
reluctance
natural
girl
shrinking
at
the
sudden
intrusion
of
marriage
into
the
pretty
comedy
of
courtship
susan
would
like
it
he
pleaded
no
she
tried
to
pull
her
hand
away
as
if
wishing
to
draw
every
particle
of
self
together
and
shut
it
all
within
her
own
protecting
shell
why
not
it
it
dont
want
to
be
married
out
here
in
the
wilds
want
to
wait
and
marry
as
other
girls
do
and
have
real
wedding
and
house
to
go
to
should
hate
it
couldnt
it
like
squaw
you
oughtnt
to
ask
it
her
terror
lent
her
an
unaccustomed
subtlety
she
eluded
the
main
issue
seizing
on
objections
that
did
not
betray
her
but
that
were
reasonable
what
might
have
been
expected
by
the
most
unsuspicious
of
men
and
as
for
your
being
afraid
of
falling
sick
in
these
dreadful
places
isnt
that
all
the
more
reason
why
should
be
free
to
give
all
my
time
and
thought
to
you
if
you
dont
feel
so
strong
then
marrying
is
the
last
thing
think
of
doing
going
to
be
with
you
all
the
time
closer
than
ever
was
before
no
man
going
to
come
between
us
marry
david
and
push
you
off
into
the
background
when
you
re
not
well
and
want
me
most
that
perfectly
ridiculous
she
meant
all
she
said
it
was
the
truth
but
it
was
the
truth
reinforced
given
fourfold
strength
by
her
own
unwillingness
the
thought
that
she
had
successfully
defeated
him
pushed
the
marriage
away
into
an
indefinite
future
relieved
her
so
that
the
dread
usually
evoked
by
his
ill
health
was
swept
aside
she
turned
on
him
face
once
again
bright
all
clouds
withdrawn
softened
into
dimpling
reassurance
what
an
idea
she
said
men
have
no
sense
very
well
spoiled
girl
suppose
we
ll
have
to
put
it
off
till
we
get
to
california
she
dropped
back
full
length
on
the
ground
and
in
the
expansion
of
her
relief
laid
her
cheek
against
the
hand
that
clasped
hers
and
until
we
get
the
house
built
she
cried
beginning
to
laugh
and
the
garden
laid
out
and
planted
suppose
of
course
and
the
vines
growing
over
the
front
porch
why
not
over
the
second
story
we
ll
have
second
story
by
that
time
over
the
whole
house
up
to
the
chimneys
they
both
laughed
cheerful
bass
and
gay
treble
sweeping
out
across
the
unquiet
water
it
going
to
be
the
golden
age
she
said
in
the
joy
of
her
respite
pressing
her
lips
on
the
hand
she
held
cottage
covered
with
vines
to
the
roof
and
you
and
and
daddy
john
inside
it
and
david
dont
forget
david
of
course
david
she
assented
lightly
for
david
occupancy
was
removed
to
comfortable
distance
after
supper
she
and
david
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
bank
to
see
the
sunset
the
breeze
had
dropped
the
dust
devils
died
with
it
the
silence
of
evening
lay
like
cool
hand
on
the
heated
earth
dusk
was
softening
the
hard
bright
colors
wiping
out
the
sharpness
of
stretching
shadows
the
baked
reflection
of
sun
on
clay
the
west
blazed
above
the
mountains
but
the
rest
of
the
sky
was
thick
pure
blue
against
it
to
the
south
single
peak
rose
snow-enameled
on
turquoise
background
susan
felt
at
peace
with
the
moment
and
her
own
soul
she
radiated
the
good
humor
of
one
who
has
faced
peril
and
escaped
having
postponed
the
event
that
was
to
make
her
david
forever
she
felt
bound
to
offer
recompense
her
conscience
went
through
one
of
those
processes
by
which
the
consciences
of
women
seek
ease
through
atonement
prompting
them
to
actions
of
baleful
kindliness
contrition
made
her
tender
to
the
man
she
did
not
love
the
thought
that
she
had
been
unfair
added
cruel
sweetness
to
her
manner
he
lay
on
the
edge
of
the
bluff
beside
her
not
saying
much
for
it
was
happiness
to
feel
her
within
touch
of
his
hand
amiable
and
gentle
as
she
had
been
of
late
it
would
have
taken
an
eye
shrewder
than
david
to
have
seen
into
the
secret
springs
of
her
conduct
he
only
knew
that
she
had
been
kinder
friendlier
less
withdrawn
into
the
sanctuary
of
her
virgin
coldness
round
which
in
the
beginning
he
had
hovered
his
heart
was
high
swelled
by
the
promise
of
her
beaming
looks
and
ready
smiles
at
last
in
this
drama
of
slow
winning
she
was
drawing
closer
shyly
melting
her
whims
and
perversities
mellowing
to
the
rich
sweet
yielding
of
the
ultimate
surrender
we
ought
to
be
at
fort
bridger
now
in
few
days
he
said
courant
says
if
all
goes
well
we
can
make
it
by
thursday
and
of
course
he
knows
courant
she
exclaimed
with
the
familiar
note
of
scorn
he
knows
little
of
everything
doesnt
he
why
dont
you
like
him
missy
he
fine
man
for
the
trail
yes
dare
say
he
is
but
that
not
everything
why
dont
you
like
him
come
tell
the
truth
they
had
spoken
before
of
her
dislike
of
courant
she
had
revealed
it
more
frankly
to
david
than
to
anyone
else
it
was
one
of
the
subjects
over
which
she
could
become
animated
in
the
weariest
hour
she
liked
to
talk
to
her
betrothed
about
it
to
impress
it
upon
him
warming
to
an
eloquence
that
allayed
her
own
unrest
dont
know
why
dont
like
him
you
cant
always
tell
why
you
like
or
dislike
person
it
just
something
that
comes
and
you
dont
know
why
but
it
seems
so
childish
and
unfair
dont
like
my
girl
to
be
unfair
has
he
ever
done
anything
or
said
anything
to
you
that
offended
you
she
gave
petulant
movement
no
but
he
thinks
so
much
of
himself
and
he
hard
and
has
no
feeling
and
oh
dont
know
it
just
that
dont
like
him
david
laughed
it
all
prejudice
you
cant
give
any
real
reason
of
course
cant
those
things
dont
always
have
reasons
you
re
always
asking
for
reasons
and
never
have
any
to
give
you
ll
have
to
teach
you
to
have
them
she
looked
slantwise
at
him
smiling
afraid
that
will
be
great
undertaking
very
stupid
about
learning
things
you
ask
father
and
daddy
john
what
terrible
task
it
was
getting
me
educated
the
only
person
that
didnt
bother
about
it
was
this
one
she
laid
finger
on
her
chest
she
never
cared
in
the
least
well
ll
begin
second
education
when
we
get
settled
ll
teach
you
to
reason
begin
now
she
folded
her
hands
demurely
in
her
lap
and
lifting
her
head
back
laughed
here
am
waiting
to
learn
no
we
want
more
time
ll
wait
till
we
re
married
her
laughter
diminished
to
smile
that
lay
on
her
lips
looking
stiff
and
uncomfortable
below
the
fixity
of
her
eyes
that
such
long
way
off
she
said
faintly
not
so
very
long
oh
california
hundreds
of
miles
away
yet
and
then
when
we
get
there
we
ve
got
to
find
place
to
settle
and
till
the
land
and
lay
out
the
garden
and
build
house
quite
nice
house
dont
want
to
live
in
cabin
father
and
have
just
been
talking
about
it
why
it
months
and
months
off
yet
he
did
not
answer
she
had
spoken
this
way
to
him
before
wafting
the
subject
away
with
evasive
words
after
pause
he
said
slowly
why
need
we
wait
so
long
we
must
not
going
to
begin
my
married
life
the
way
the
emigrant
women
do
want
to
live
decently
and
be
comfortable
he
broke
sprig
off
sage
bush
and
began
to
pluck
it
apart
she
had
receded
to
her
defenses
and
peeped
nervously
at
him
from
behind
them
fort
bridger
he
said
his
eyes
on
the
twig
is
big
place
sort
of
rendezvous
for
all
kinds
of
people
she
stared
at
him
her
face
alert
with
apprehension
ready
to
dart
into
her
citadel
and
lower
the
drawbridge
sometimes
there
are
missionaries
stopping
there
missionaries
she
exclaimed
in
high
key
hate
missionaries
this
was
surprising
statement
david
knew
the
doctor
to
be
supporter
and
believer
in
the
indian
missions
and
had
often
heard
his
daughter
acquiesce
in
his
opinions
why
do
you
hate
them
dont
know
there
another
thing
you
want
reason
for
it
getting
cold
up
here
let
go
down
by
the
fire
she
gathered
herself
together
to
rise
but
he
turned
quickly
upon
her
and
his
face
while
it
made
her
shrink
also
arrested
her
she
had
come
to
dread
that
expression
persuasion
hardened
into
desperate
pleading
it
woke
in
her
shocked
repugnance
as
though
something
had
been
revealed
to
her
that
she
had
no
right
to
see
she
felt
shame
for
him
that
he
must
beg
where
man
should
conquer
and
subdue
wait
moment
he
said
why
cant
one
of
those
missionaries
marry
us
there
she
had
scrambled
to
her
knees
and
snatched
at
her
skirt
preparatory
to
the
jump
to
her
feet
no
she
said
vehemently
no
what
the
matter
with
you
all
talking
about
marriages
and
missionaries
when
we
re
in
the
middle
of
the
wilds
susan
he
cried
catching
at
her
dress
just
listen
moment
could
take
care
of
you
then
take
care
of
you
properly
you
be
my
own
to
look
after
and
work
for
it
seemed
to
me
lately
you
loved
me
enough
wouldnt
have
suggested
such
thing
if
you
were
as
you
were
in
the
beginning
but
you
seem
to
care
now
you
seem
as
if
as
if
it
wouldnt
be
so
hard
for
you
to
live
with
me
and
let
me
love
you
she
jerked
her
skirt
away
and
leaped
to
her
feet
crying
again
no
david
no
not
for
minute
he
rose
too
very
pale
the
piece
of
sage
in
his
hand
shaking
they
looked
at
each
other
the
yellow
light
clear
on
both
faces
hers
was
hard
and
combative
as
if
his
suggestion
had
outraged
her
and
she
was
ready
to
fight
it
its
expression
sent
shaft
of
terror
to
his
soul
for
with
all
his
unselfishness
he
was
selfish
in
his
man
longing
for
her
hungered
for
her
till
his
hunger
had
made
him
blind
now
in
flash
of
clairvoyance
he
saw
truly
and
feeling
the
joy
of
life
slipping
from
him
faltered
have
made
mistake
dont
you
care
it
was
her
opportunity
she
was
master
of
her
fate
but
her
promise
was
still
thing
that
held
the
moment
had
not
come
when
she
saw
nothing
but
her
own
desire
and
to
gain
it
would
have
sacrificed
all
that
stood
between
his
stricken
look
his
expression
of
nerving
himself
for
blow
pierced
her
and
her
words
rushed
out
in
burst
of
contrition
of
course
of
course
do
dont
doubt
me
dont
but
oh
david
dont
torment
me
dont
ask
anything
like
that
now
cant
cant
not
ready
not
yet
her
voice
broke
and
she
put
her
hand
to
her
mouth
to
hide
its
trembling
over
it
her
eyes
suddenly
brimming
with
tears
looked
imploringly
into
his
it
was
heart-tearing
sight
to
the
lover
he
forgot
himself
and
without
knowing
what
he
did
opened
his
arms
to
inclose
her
in
an
embrace
of
pity
and
remorse
oh
dearest
ll
never
ask
it
till
you
re
willing
to
come
to
me
he
cried
and
saw
her
back
away
with
upheld
shoulders
raised
in
defense
against
his
hands
wont
touch
you
he
said
quickly
dropping
his
arms
dont
draw
back
from
me
if
you
dont
want
it
ll
never
lay
finger
on
you
the
rigidity
of
her
attitude
relaxed
she
turned
away
her
head
and
wiped
her
tears
on
the
end
of
the
kerchief
knotted
round
her
neck
he
stood
watching
her
struggling
with
passion
and
foreboding
reassured
and
yet
with
the
memory
of
the
seeing
moment
chill
at
his
heart
presently
she
shot
timid
glance
at
him
and
met
his
eyes
resting
questioningly
upon
her
her
face
was
tear
stained
slight
frightened
smile
on
the
lips
sorry
she
whispered
susan
do
you
truly
care
for
me
yes
she
said
looking
down
yes
but
let
me
wait
little
while
longer
as
long
as
you
like
ll
never
ask
you
to
marry
me
till
you
say
you
re
willing
she
held
out
her
hand
shyly
as
if
fearing
repulse
he
took
it
and
feeling
it
relinquished
to
his
with
trust
and
confidence
swore
that
never
again
would
he
disturb
her
never
demand
of
her

from

down

caught
the

party
and
was
drawing
it
to
the
focus
they
reckoned
the
days
on
their
fingers
and
pressed
forward
with
feverish
hurry
they
were
like
wayworn
mariners
who
sight
the
lights
of
port
dead
desires
revived
blew
into
glow
extinguished
vanities
they
looked
at
each
other
and
for
the
first
time
realized
how
ragged
and
unkempt
they
were
then
dragged
out
best
clothes
from
the
bottom
of
their
chests
and
hung
their
looking-glasses
to
the
limbs
of
trees
they
were
coming
to
the
surface
after
period
of
submersion
susan
fastened
her
mirror
to
the
twig
on
an
alder
trunk
and
ransacked
her
store
of
finery
it
yielded
up
new
red
merino
bodice
and
the
occasion
was
great
enough
to
warrant
breaking
into
her
reserve
of
hairpins
then
she
experimented
with
her
hair
parted
and
rolled
it
in
the
form
that
had
been
the
fashion
in
that
long
dead
past
was
it
twenty
years
ago
when
she
had
been
girl
in
rochester
she
inspected
her
reflected
image
with
fearful
curiosity
as
if
expecting
to
find
gray
hairs
and
wrinkles
it
was
pleasant
to
see
that
she
looked
the
same
trifle
thinner
may
be
and
as
she
noted
that
her
cheeks
were
not
as
roundly
curved
the
fullness
of
her
throat
had
melted
to
more
muscular
less
creased
and
creamy
firmness
she
felt
glow
of
satisfaction
for
in
those
distant
days
twenty-five
years
ago
it
must
be
she
had
worried
because
she
was
little
too
fat
no
one
could
say
that
now
she
stole
look
over
her
shoulder
to
make
sure
she
was
not
watched
it
seemed
an
absurdly
vain
thing
to
do
and
turned
back
the
neck
of
her
blouse
the
faintest
rise
of
collar
bone
showed
under
the
satiny
skin
fine
as
magnolia
petal
the
color
of
faintly
tinted
meerschaum
she
ran
her
hand
across
it
and
it
was
smooth
as
curds
yielding
with
an
elastic
resistance
over
its
bedding
of
firm
flesh
the
young
girl
pride
in
her
beauty
rose
bringing
with
it
sense
of
surprise
she
had
thought
it
gone
forever
and
now
it
still
held
the
one
surviving
sensation
that
connected
her
with
that
other
susan
gillespie
who
had
lived
half
century
ago
in
rochester
it
was
the
day
after
this
recrudescence
of
old
coquetry
that
the
first
tragedy
of
the
trail
the
tragedy
that
was
hers
alone
smote
her
the
march
that
morning
had
been
over
high
level
across
which
they
headed
for
small
river
they
would
follow
to
the
fort
early
in
the
afternoon
they
saw
its
course
traced
in
intricate
embroidery
across
the
earth
leathern
carpet
the
road
dropped
into
it
the
trail
grooved
deep
between
ramparts
of
clay
on
the
lip
of
the
descent
the
wayward
julia
maddened
with
thirst
plunged
forward
her
obedient
mates
followed
and
the
wagon
went
hurling
down
the
slant
dust
rising
like
the
smoke
of
an
explosion
the
men
struggled
for
control
and
seized
by
the
contagion
of
their
excitement
the
doctor
laid
hold
of
wheel
it
jerked
him
from
his
feet
and
flung
him
sprawling
stunned
by
the
impact
thin
trickle
of
blood
issuing
from
his
lips
the
others
saw
nothing
in
the
tumult
did
not
hear
susan
cry
when
they
came
back
the
doctor
was
lying
where
he
had
fallen
and
she
was
sitting
beside
him
wiping
his
lips
with
the
kerchief
she
had
torn
from
her
neck
she
looked
up
at
them
and
said
it
hemorrhage
her
face
shocked
them
into
an
understanding
of
the
gravity
of
the
accident
it
was
swept
clean
of
its
dauntless
rosy
youth
had
stiffened
into
an
unelastic
skin
surface
taut
over
rigid
muscles
but
her
eyes
were
loopholes
through
which
anguish
escaped
bending
them
on
her
father
hungry
solicitude
suffused
them
too
all-pervading
to
be
denied
exit
turned
to
the
men
an
agonized
questioning
took
its
place
it
spoke
to
them
like
cry
cry
of
weakness
cry
for
succor
it
was
the
first
admission
of
their
strength
she
had
ever
made
the
first
look
upon
them
which
had
said
you
are
men
am
woman
help
me
they
carried
the
doctor
to
the
banks
of
the
stream
and
laid
him
on
spread
robe
he
protested
that
it
was
nothing
it
had
happened
before
several
times
missy
would
remember
it
last
winter
in
rochester
her
answering
smile
was
pitiable
grimace
of
the
lips
that
went
no
farther
she
felt
its
failure
and
turned
away
plucking
at
weed
near
her
courant
saw
the
trembling
of
her
hand
and
the
swallowing
movement
of
her
throat
bared
of
its
sheltering
kerchief
she
glanced
up
with
stealthy
side
look
fearful
that
her
moment
of
weakness
was
spied
upon
and
saw
him
the
pity
surging
from
his
heart
shining
on
his
face
like
softening
light
she
shrank
from
it
and
as
he
made
an
involuntary
step
toward
her
warned
him
off
with
quick
gesture
he
turned
to
the
camp
and
set
furiously
to
work
his
hands
shaking
as
he
drove
in
the
picket
pins
his
throat
dry
he
did
not
dare
to
look
at
her
again
the
desire
to
snatch
her
in
his
arms
to
hold
her
close
till
he
crushed
her
in
passion
of
protecting
tenderness
made
him
fear
to
look
at
her
to
hear
her
voice
to
let
the
air
of
her
moving
body
touch
him
the
next
morning
while
lifting
the
doctor
into
the
wagon
there
was
second
hemorrhage
even
the
sick
man
found
it
difficult
to
maintain
his
cheery
insouciance
susan
looked
pinched
her
tongue
seemed
hardened
to
the
consistency
of
leather
that
could
not
flex
for
the
ready
utterance
of
words
the
entire
sum
of
her
consciousness
was
focused
on
her
father
breakfast
with
blank
glance
at
the
speaker
is
it
breakfast
time
the
men
cooked
for
her
and
brought
her
cup
of
coffee
and
her
plate
of
food
she
set
them
on
the
driver
seat
and
when
the
doctor
keeping
his
head
immovable
and
turning
smiling
eyes
upon
her
told
her
to
eat
she
felt
for
them
like
blind
woman
it
was
hard
to
swallow
the
coffee
took
effort
to
force
it
down
channel
that
was
suddenly
narrowed
to
parched
resistent
tube
she
would
answer
no
one
seemed
to
have
undergone
an
ossifying
of
all
faculties
turned
to
the
sounds
and
sights
of
life
david
remembered
her
state
when
the
doctor
had
been
ill
on
the
platte
but
the
exclusion
of
the
outer
world
was
then
an
obsession
of
worry
jealous
distraction
as
if
she
resented
the
well-being
of
others
when
hers
were
forced
to
suffer
this
was
different
she
did
not
draw
away
from
him
now
she
did
not
seem
to
see
or
hear
him
her
glance
lit
unknowing
on
his
face
her
hand
lay
in
his
passive
as
thing
of
stone
sometimes
he
thought
she
did
not
know
who
he
was
cant
we
do
anything
to
cheer
her
or
take
her
mind
off
it
he
said
to
daddy
john
behind
the
wagon
the
old
man
gave
him
glance
of
tolerant
scorn
you
cant
take
person
mind
off
the
only
thing
that
in
it
she
got
nothing
inside
her
but
worry
she
filled
up
with
it
level
to
the
top
you
might
as
well
try
and
stop
pail
from
overflowing
that
too
full
of
water
they
fared
on
for
two
interminable
broiling
days
the
pace
was
of
the
slowest
for
jolt
or
wrench
of
the
wagon
might
cause
another
hemorrhage
with
cautious
observance
of
stones
and
chuck
holes
they
crawled
down
the
road
that
edged
the
river
the
sun
was
blinding
beating
on
the
canvas
hood
till
the
girl
face
was
beaded
with
sweat
and
the
sick
man
blankets
were
hot
against
the
intenser
heat
of
his
body
outside
the
world
held
its
breath
spellbound
in
white
dazzle
the
river
sparkled
like
coat
of
mail
the
only
unquiet
thing
on
the
earth
incandescent
surface
when
the
afternoon
declined
shadows
crept
from
the
opposite
bluffs
slanted
across
the
water
slipped
toward
the
little
caravan
and
engulfed
it
through
the
front
opening
susan
watched
the
road
there
was
time
when
each
dust
ridge
showed
side
of
bright
blue
to
half-shut
eyes
they
were
like
painted
stripes
weaving
toward
the
distance
following
them
to
where
the
trail
bent
round
buttress
her
glance
brought
up
on
courant
mounted
figure
he
seemed
the
vanishing
point
of
these
converging
stripes
the
object
they
were
striving
toward
the
end
they
aimed
for
reaching
him
they
ceased
as
though
they
had
accomplished
their
purpose
led
the
woman
eyes
to
him
as
to
symbolical
figure
that
piloted
the
train
to
succor
with
every
hour
weakness
grew
on
the
doctor
his
words
were
fewer
by
the
ending
of
the
first
day
he
lay
silent
looking
out
at
the
vista
of
bluffs
and
river
his
eyes
shining
in
sunken
orbits
as
dusk
fell
courant
dropped
back
to
the
wagon
and
asked
daddy
john
if
the
mules
could
hold
the
pace
all
night
susan
heard
the
whispered
conference
and
in
moment
was
kneeling
on
the
seat
her
hand
clutched
like
spread
starfish
on
the
old
man
shoulder
courant
leaned
from
his
saddle
to
catch
the
driver
ear
with
his
lowered
tones
with
forced
march
we
can
get
there
to-morrow
afternoon
the
animals
can
rest
up
and
we
can
make
him
comfortable
and
maybe
find
doctor
her
face
lifted
to
him
was
like
transparent
medium
through
which
anxiety
and
hope
that
was
almost
pain
shone
she
hung
on
his
words
and
breathed
back
quick
agreement
it
would
have
been
the
same
if
he
had
suggested
the
impossible
if
the
angel
of
the
lord
had
appeared
and
barred
the
way
with
flaming
sword
of
course
they
can
go
all
night
they
must
we
ll
walk
and
ride
by
turns
that
ll
lighten
the
wagon
ll
go
and
get
my
horse
and
she
was
out
and
gone
to
the
back
of
the
train
where
david
rode
at
the
head
of
the
pack
animals
the
night
was
of
clear
blue
darkness
suffused
with
the
misty
light
of
stars
looking
back
courant
could
see
her
upright
slenderness
topping
the
horse
black
shape
when
the
road
lay
pale
and
unshaded
behind
her
he
could
decipher
the
curves
of
her
head
and
shoulders
then
he
turned
to
the
trail
in
front
and
her
face
as
it
had
been
when
he
first
saw
her
and
as
it
was
now
came
back
to
his
memory
once
toward
midnight
he
drew
up
till
they
reached
him
her
horse
muzzle
nosing
soft
against
his
pony
flank
he
could
see
the
gleam
of
her
eyes
fastened
on
him
wide
and
anxious
get
into
the
wagon
and
ride
he
commanded
why
he
no
worse
he
sleeping
was
thinking
of
you
this
is
too
hard
for
you
it
ll
wear
you
out
oh
all
right
she
said
with
slight
movement
of
impatience
dont
worry
about
me
go
on
he
returned
to
his
post
and
she
paced
slowly
on
keeping
level
with
the
wheels
it
was
very
still
only
the
creaking
of
the
wagon
and
the
hoof
beats
on
the
dust
she
kept
her
eyes
on
his
receding
shape
watched
it
disappear
in
dark
turns
then
emerge
into
faintly
illumined
stretches
it
moved
steadily
without
quickening
of
gait
lonely
shadow
that
they
followed
through
the
unknown
to
hope
her
glance
hung
to
it
her
ear
strained
for
the
thud
of
his
pony
feet
sight
and
sound
of
him
came
to
her
like
promise
of
help
he
was
the
one
strong
human
thing
in
this
place
of
remote
skies
and
dumb
unfeeling
earth
it
was
late
afternoon
when
the
fort
came
in
sight
flicker
of
animation
burst
up
in
them
as
they
saw
the
square
of
its
long
low
walls
crowning
an
eminence
above
the
stream
the
bottom
lay
wide
at
its
feet
the
river
slipping
bright
through
green
meadows
sprinkled
with
an
army
of
cattle
in
vast
irregular
circle
wheel
of
life
with
the
fort
as
its
hub
spread
an
engirdling
encampment
it
was
scattered
over
plain
and
bottom
in
dottings
of
white
here
drawn
close
in
clustering
agglomerations
there
detached
in
separate
spatterings
coming
nearer
the
white
spots
grew
to
wagon
hoods
and
tent
roofs
and
among
them
less
easy
to
discern
were
the
pointed
summits
of
the
lodges
with
the
bunched
poles
bristling
through
the
top
the
air
was
very
still
and
into
it
rose
the
straight
threads
of
smoke
from
countless
fires
aspiring
upwards
in
slender
blue
lines
to
the
bluer
sky
they
lifted
and
dispersed
the
smell
of
burning
wood
that
comes
to
the
wanderer
with
message
of
home
message
that
has
lain
in
his
blood
since
the
first
man
struck
fire
and
turned
the
dry
heap
of
sticks
to
an
altar
to
be
forever
fixed
as
the
soul
of
his
habitation
they
camped
in
the
bottom
withdrawn
from
the
closer
herding
of
tents
it
was
slow
settling
as
noiseless
as
might
be
for
two
at
least
of
their
number
knew
that
the
doctor
was
dying
that
afternoon
daddy
john
and
courant
had
seen
the
shadow
of
the
great
change
whether
susan
saw
it
they
neither
knew
she
was
full
of
determined
cold
energy
urging
them
at
once
to
go
among
the
camps
and
search
for
doctor
they
went
in
different
directions
leaving
her
sitting
by
her
father
feet
at
the
raised
flap
of
the
tent
looking
back
through
the
gathering
dusk
courant
could
see
her
dark
shape
her
body
drooping
in
relaxed
lines
he
thought
that
she
knew
when
they
came
back
with
the
word
that
there
was
no
doctor
to
be
found
darkness
was
closing
in
night
came
with
noises
of
men
and
the
twinkling
of
innumerable
lights
the
sky
pricked
with
stars
looked
down
on
an
earth
alive
with
answering
gleams
as
though
segment
of
its
spark-set
shield
had
fallen
and
lay
beneath
it
winking
back
messages
in
an
aerial
telegraphy
the
fires
leaped
high
or
glowed
in
smoldering
mounds
painting
the
sides
of
tents
the
flanks
of
ruminating
animals
the
wheels
of
wagons
the
faces
of
men
and
women
coolness
rest
peace
brooded
over
the
great
bivouac
with
the
guardian
shape
of
the
fort
above
it
and
the
murmur
of
the
river
at
its
feet
lantern
standing
on
box
by
the
doctor
side
lit
the
tent
through
the
opening
the
light
from
the
fire
outside
poured
in
sending
shadows
scurrying
up
the
canvas
walls
close
within
call
david
sat
by
it
his
chin
on
his
knees
his
eyes
staring
at
the
tongues
of
flames
as
they
licked
the
fresh
wood
there
was
nothing
now
for
him
to
do
he
had
cooked
the
supper
and
then
to
ease
the
pain
of
his
unclaimed
sympathies
cleaned
the
pans
and
from
neighboring
camp
brought
piece
of
deer
meat
for
susan
it
was
the
only
way
he
could
serve
her
and
he
sat
disconsolately
looking
now
at
the
meat
on
tin
plate
then
toward
the
tent
where
she
and
daddy
john
were
talking
he
could
hear
the
murmur
of
their
voices
see
their
silhouettes
moving
on
the
canvas
gigantic
and
grotesque
presently
she
appeared
in
the
opening
paused
there
for
last
word
and
then
came
toward
him
he
wants
to
speak
to
daddy
john
for
moment
she
said
and
dropping
on
the
ground
beside
him
stared
at
the
fire
david
looked
at
her
longingly
but
he
dared
not
intrude
upon
her
somber
abstraction
the
voices
in
the
tent
rose
and
fell
once
at
louder
phrase
from
daddy
john
she
turned
her
head
quickly
and
listened
sheaf
of
strained
nerves
the
voices
dropped
again
her
eye
came
back
to
the
light
and
touched
the
young
man
face
it
contained
no
recognition
of
him
but
he
leaped
at
the
chance
making
stammering
proffer
of
such
aid
as
he
could
give
ve
got
you
some
supper
he
lifted
the
plate
but
she
shook
her
head
let
me
cook
it
for
you
he
pleaded
you
havent
eaten
anything
since
morning
cant
eat
she
said
and
fell
back
to
her
fire-gazing
slipping
away
from
him
into
the
forbidding
dumbness
of
her
thoughts
he
could
only
watch
her
hoping
for
word
an
expressed
wish
when
it
came
it
was
alas
outside
his
power
to
gratify
if
there
had
only
been
doctor
here
that
was
what
was
hoping
for
and
so
when
she
asked
for
the
help
he
yearned
to
give
it
was
his
fate
that
he
should
meet
her
longing
with
hopeless
silence
when
daddy
john
emerged
from
the
tent
she
leaped
to
her
feet
well
she
said
with
low
eagerness
go
back
to
him
he
wants
you
answered
the
old
man
ve
got
something
to
do
for
him
he
made
no
attempt
to
touch
her
his
words
and
voice
were
brusque
yet
david
saw
that
she
responded
softened
showed
the
ragged
wound
of
her
pain
to
him
as
she
did
to
no
one
else
it
was
an
understanding
that
went
beneath
all
externals
words
were
unnecessary
between
them
heart
spoke
to
heart
she
returned
to
the
tent
and
sunk
on
the
skin
beside
her
father
he
smiled
faintly
and
stretched
hand
for
hers
and
her
fingers
slipped
between
his
cool
and
strong
against
the
lifeless
dryness
of
his
palm
she
gave
back
his
smile
bravely
her
eyes
steadfast
she
had
no
desire
for
tears
no
acuteness
of
sensation
weight
as
heavy
as
the
world
lay
on
her
crushing
out
struggle
and
resistance
she
knew
that
he
was
dying
when
they
told
her
there
was
no
doctor
in
the
camp
her
flickering
hope
had
gone
out
now
she
was
prepared
to
sit
by
him
and
wait
with
lethargic
patience
beyond
which
was
nothing
he
pressed
her
hand
and
said
ve
sent
daddy
john
on
hunt
do
you
guess
what
for
she
shook
her
head
feeling
no
curiosity
the
time
is
short
missy
the
living
instinct
to
fight
against
the
acquiescence
of
the
dying
prompted
her
to
the
utterance
of
sharp
no
want
it
all
arranged
and
settled
before
it
too
late
sent
him
to
see
if
there
was
missionary
here
she
was
leaning
against
the
couch
of
robes
resting
on
the
piled
support
of
the
skins
in
the
pause
after
his
words
she
slowly
drew
herself
upright
and
with
her
mouth
slightly
open
inhaled
deep
breath
her
eyes
remained
fixed
on
him
gleaming
from
the
shadow
of
her
brows
and
their
expression
combined
with
the
amaze
of
the
dropped
underlip
gave
her
look
of
wild
attention
why
she
said
the
word
came
obstructed
and
she
repeated
it
want
you
to
marry
david
here
to-night
the
doctor
watch
on
box
at
the
bed
head
ticked
loudly
in
the
silence
they
looked
at
each
other
unconscious
of
the
length
of
the
pause
death
on
the
one
hand
life
pressing
for
its
due
on
the
other
were
the
only
facts
they
recognized
hostility
not
to
the
man
but
to
the
idea
drove
the
amazement
from
her
face
and
hardened
its
softness
to
stone
here
to-night
she
said
her
comprehension
stimulated
by
an
automatic
repetition
of
his
words
yes
may
not
be
able
to
understand
tomorrow
she
moved
her
head
her
glance
touching
the
watch
the
lantern
then
dropping
to
the
hand
curled
round
her
own
it
seemed
symbolic
of
the
will
against
which
hers
was
rising
in
combat
she
made
an
involuntary
effort
to
withdraw
her
fingers
but
his
closed
tighter
on
them
why
she
whispered
again
some
one
must
take
care
of
you
cant
leave
you
alone
she
answered
with
stiffened
lips
there
daddy
john
some
one
closer
than
daddy
john
want
to
leave
you
with
david
her
antagonism
rose
higher
sweeping
over
her
wretchedness
worn
and
strained
she
had
difficulty
to
keep
her
lips
shut
on
it
to
prevent
herself
from
crying
out
her
outraged
protests
all
her
dormant
womanhood
stirring
to
wakefulness
in
the
last
few
weeks
broke
into
life
gathering
itself
in
passion
of
revolt
abhorrent
of
the
indignity
ready
to
flare
into
vehement
refusal
to
the
dim
eyes
fastened
on
her
she
was
merely
the
girl
reluctant
still
he
watched
her
down-drooped
face
and
said
then
could
go
in
peace
am
asking
too
much
she
made
negative
movement
with
her
head
and
turned
her
face
away
from
him
you
ll
do
this
for
my
happiness
now
anything
she
murmured
it
will
be
also
for
your
own
he
moved
his
free
hand
and
clasped
it
on
the
mound
made
by
their
locked
fingers
through
the
stillness
man
voice
singing
zavier
canadian
song
came
to
them
it
stopped
at
the
girl
outer
ear
but
like
hail
from
fading
land
penetrated
to
the
man
brain
and
he
stirred
hist
he
said
raising
his
brows
there
that
french
song
your
mother
used
to
sing
the
distant
voice
rose
to
the
plaintive
burden
and
he
lay
motionless
his
eyes
filmed
with
memories
as
the
present
dimmed
the
past
grew
clearer
his
hold
on
the
moment
relaxed
and
he
slipped
away
from
it
on
tide
of
recollection
muttering
the
words
the
girl
sat
mute
her
hand
cold
under
his
her
being
passing
in
an
agonized
birth
throe
from
unconsciousness
to
self-recognition
her
will
its
strength
till
now
unguessed
rose
resistant
thing
of
iron
love
was
too
strong
in
her
for
open
opposition
but
the
instinct
to
fight
blindly
but
with
caution
for
the
right
to
herself
was
stronger
his
murmuring
died
into
silence
and
she
looked
at
him
his
eyes
were
closed
the
pressure
of
his
fingers
loosened
light
sleep
held
him
and
under
its
truce
she
softly
withdrew
her
hand
then
stole
to
the
tent
door
and
stood
there
waiting
moment
stifling
her
hurried
breathing
she
saw
david
lying
by
the
fire
gazing
into
its
smoldering
heart
with
noiseless
feet
she
skirted
the
encircling
ropes
and
pegs
and
stood
out
of
range
of
his
eye
on
the
farther
side
here
she
stopped
withdrawn
from
the
light
that
came
amber
soft
through
the
canvas
walls
slipping
into
shadow
when
figure
passed
searching
the
darkness
with
peering
eyes
around
her
the
noises
of
the
camp
rose
less
sharp
than
an
hour
earlier
the
night
silence
gradually
hushing
them
the
sparks
and
shooting
gleams
of
fires
still
quivered
imbued
with
tenacious
life
she
had
momentary
glimpse
of
naked
indian
boy
flinging
loose
his
blanket
bronze
statue
glistening
in
leap
of
flame
nearer
by
woman
figure
bent
over
kettle
black
on
bed
of
embers
then
girl
fire-touched
form
with
raised
arms
shaking
down
snake
of
hair
which
broke
and
grew
cloudy
under
her
disturbing
hands
resounding
smack
sounded
on
horse
flank
low
ripple
of
laughter
came
tangled
with
child
querulous
crying
and
through
the
walls
of
tents
and
the
thickness
of
smoke
the
notes
of
flute
filtered
her
ear
caught
the
pad
of
footstep
on
the
grass
and
her
eyes
seized
on
shadow
that
grew
from
dusky
uncertainty
to
small
bent
shape
she
waited
suffocated
with
heartbeats
then
made
noiseless
pounce
on
it
daddy
john
she
gasped
clutching
at
him
the
old
man
staggered
almost
taken
off
his
feet
is
he
worse
he
said
he
told
me
did
you
find
anyone
yes
two
one
episcopal
in
train
from
st
louis
sound
came
from
her
that
he
did
not
understand
she
gripped
at
his
shoulders
as
if
she
were
drowning
he
thought
she
was
about
to
swoon
and
put
his
arm
around
her
saying
come
back
to
the
tent
you
re
all
on
shake
as
if
you
had
ague
cant
go
back
dont
bring
him
dont
bring
him
dont
tell
father
not
now
will
later
some
other
time
when
we
get
to
california
but
not
now
not
to-night
the
sentences
were
cut
apart
by
breaths
that
broke
from
her
as
if
she
had
been
running
he
was
frightened
and
tried
to
draw
her
to
the
light
and
see
her
face
why
missy
he
said
with
scared
helplessness
why
missy
what
got
you
dont
get
the
clergyman
tell
him
there
isnt
any
tell
him
you
ve
looked
all
over
tell
him
lie
he
guessed
the
trouble
was
something
more
than
the
grief
of
the
moment
and
urged
in
whisper
what
the
matter
now
go
ahead
and
tell
me
ll
stick
by
you
she
bent
her
head
back
to
look
into
his
face
dont
want
to
marry
him
now
cant
cant
cant
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
shook
him
with
each
repetition
the
force
of
the
words
was
heightened
by
the
suppressed
tone
they
should
have
been
screamed
in
these
whispered
breaths
they
burst
from
her
like
blood
from
wound
with
the
last
one
her
head
bowed
forward
on
his
shoulder
with
movement
of
burrowing
as
though
she
would
have
crawled
up
and
hidden
under
his
skin
and
tears
the
most
violent
he
had
ever
seen
her
shed
broke
from
her
they
came
in
bursting
sobs
succession
of
rending
throes
that
she
struggled
to
stifle
swaying
and
quivering
under
their
stress
he
thought
of
nothing
now
but
this
new
pain
added
to
the
hour
tragedy
and
stroked
her
shoulder
with
low
keep
quiet
keep
quiet
then
leaned
his
face
against
her
hair
and
breathed
through
its
tangles
it
all
right
ll
do
it
ll
say
couldnt
find
anyone
ll
lie
for
you
missy
she
released
him
at
once
dropped
back
step
and
lifting
distorted
face
gave
nod
he
passed
on
and
she
fell
on
the
grass
close
to
the
tent
ropes
and
lay
there
hidden
by
the
darkness
she
did
not
hear
step
approaching
from
the
herded
tents
had
she
been
listening
it
would
have
been
hard
to
discern
for
the
feet
were
moccasin
shod
falling
noiseless
on
the
muffling
grass
man
figure
with
fringes
wavering
along
its
outline
came
round
the
tent
wall
the
head
was
thrust
forward
the
ear
alert
for
voices
faring
softly
his
foot
struck
her
and
he
bent
stretching
down
feeling
hand
it
touched
her
shoulder
slipped
along
her
side
and
gripped
at
her
arm
what
the
matter
came
deep
voice
and
feeling
the
pull
on
her
arm
she
got
to
her
knees
with
strangled
whisper
for
silence
when
the
light
fell
across
her
he
gave
smothered
cry
jerked
her
to
her
feet
and
thrust
his
hand
into
her
hair
drawing
her
head
back
till
her
face
was
uplifted
to
his
there
was
no
one
to
see
and
he
let
his
eyes
feed
full
upon
it
thief
with
the
coveted
treasure
in
his
hands
she
seemed
unconscious
of
him
broken
thing
without
sense
or
volition
till
stir
came
from
the
tent
then
he
felt
her
resist
his
grasp
she
put
hand
on
his
breast
and
pressed
herself
back
from
him
hush
she
breathed
daddy
john
in
there
shadow
ran
up
the
canvas
wall
bobbing
on
it
huge
and
wavering
she
turned
her
head
toward
it
the
tears
on
her
cheeks
glazed
by
the
light
he
watched
her
with
widened
nostrils
and
immovable
eyes
in
the
mutual
suspension
of
action
that
held
them
he
could
feel
her
heart
beating
well
came
the
doctor
voice
the
old
servant
answered
there
werent
no
parsons
anywhere
ve
been
all
over
and
there
not
one
parsons
courant
breathed
she
drew
in
the
fingers
spread
on
his
breast
with
clawing
movement
and
emitted
an
inarticulate
sound
that
meant
hush
not
clergyman
or
missionary
among
all
these
people
not
one
we
must
wait
till
to-morrow
then
yes
mebbe
there
ll
be
one
to-morrow
hope
so
then
silence
fell
and
the
shadow
flickered
again
on
the
canvas
she
made
struggle
against
courant
hold
which
for
moment
he
tried
to
resist
but
her
fingers
plucked
against
his
hand
and
she
tore
herself
free
and
ran
to
the
tent
opening
she
entered
without
speaking
threw
herself
at
the
foot
of
the
couch
and
laid
her
head
against
her
father
knees
is
that
you
missy
he
said
feeling
for
her
with
groping
hand
daddy
john
couldnt
find
clergyman
know
she
answered
and
lay
without
moving
her
face
buried
in
the
folds
of
the
blanket
they
said
no
more
and
daddy
john
stole
out
of
the
tent
the
next
day
the
doctor
was
too
ill
to
ask
for
clergyman
to
know
or
to
care
at
nightfall
he
died
the
emigrant
trail
had
levied
its
first
tribute
on
them
taken
its
toll

they
were
camped
on
the
edges
of
that
harsh
land
which
lay
between
the
great
salt
lake
and
the
sierra
behind
them
the
still
heavy
reach
of
water
stretched
reflecting
in
mirrored
clearness
the
mountains
crowding
on
its
southern
rim
before
them
the
sage
reached
out
to
dim
infinities
of
distance
the
humboldt
ran
nearby
sunk
in
stony
bed
its
banks
matted
with
growths
of
alder
and
willow
the
afternoon
was
drawing
to
the
magical
sunset
hour
susan
lying
by
the
door
of
her
tent
could
see
below
the
growing
western
blaze
the
bowl
of
the
earth
filling
with
the
first
liquid
oozings
of
twilight
week
ago
they
had
left
the
fort
to
her
it
had
been
blank
space
of
time
upon
which
no
outer
interest
had
intruded
she
had
presented
an
invulnerable
surface
to
all
that
went
on
about
her
the
men
care
the
day
incidents
the
setting
of
the
way
cold-eyed
and
dumb
she
had
moved
with
them
an
inanimate
idol
unresponsive
to
the
observances
of
their
worship
aloof
from
them
in
somber
uncommunicated
musings
the
men
respected
her
sorrow
did
her
work
for
her
and
let
her
alone
to
them
she
was
set
apart
in
the
sanctuary
of
her
mourning
and
that
her
grief
should
express
itself
by
hours
of
drooping
silence
was
thing
they
accepted
without
striving
to
understand
once
or
twice
david
tried
to
speak
to
her
of
her
father
but
it
seemed
to
rouse
in
her
an
irritated
and
despairing
pain
she
begged
him
to
desist
and
got
away
from
him
as
quickly
as
she
could
climbing
into
the
wagon
and
lying
on
the
sacks
with
bright
unwinking
eyes
fastened
on
daddy
john
back
but
she
did
not
rest
stunned
under
an
unexpected
blow
as
they
thought
she
was
acutely
alive
bewildered
but
with
senses
keen
as
if
the
world
had
taken
dizzying
revolution
and
she
had
come
up
panting
and
clutching
among
the
fragments
of
what
had
been
her
life
if
there
had
been
some
one
to
whom
she
could
have
turned
relieving
herself
by
confession
she
might
have
found
solace
and
set
her
feet
in
safer
ways
but
among
the
three
men
she
was
virtually
alone
guarding
her
secret
with
that
most
stubborn
of
all
silences
girl
in
the
first
wakening
of
sex
she
had
superstitious
hope
that
she
could
regain
peace
and
self-respect
by
an
act
of
reparation
and
at
such
moments
turned
with
expiatory
passion
to
the
thought
of
david
she
would
go
to
california
live
as
her
father
had
wished
marry
her
betrothed
and
be
as
good
wife
to
him
as
man
could
have
and
for
space
these
thoughts
brought
her
ease
consoled
her
as
compensating
act
of
martyrdom
she
shunned
courant
rarely
addressing
him
keeping
her
horse
to
the
rear
of
the
train
where
the
wagon
hood
hid
him
from
her
but
when
his
foot
fell
on
the
dust
beside
her
or
he
dropped
back
for
word
with
daddy
john
stealthy
observant
quietude
held
her
frame
she
turned
her
eyes
from
him
as
from
an
unholy
sight
but
it
was
useless
for
her
mental
vision
called
up
his
figure
painted
in
yellow
and
red
upon
the
background
of
the
sage
she
knew
the
expression
of
the
lithe
body
as
it
leaned
from
the
saddle
the
gnarled
hand
from
which
the
rein
hung
loose
the
eyes
diamond
hard
and
clear
living
sparks
set
in
leathery
skin
wrinkled
against
the
glare
of
the
waste
she
did
not
lie
to
herself
any
more
no
delusions
could
live
in
this
land
stripped
of
all
conciliatory
deception
the
night
before
they
left
the
fort
the
men
had
had
consultation
sitting
apart
by
the
tent
she
had
watched
them
david
and
daddy
john
between
her
and
the
fire
courant
beyond
it
his
face
red
lit
between
the
hanging
locks
of
hair
his
quick
eyes
shifting
from
one
man
to
the
other
was
keen
with
furtive
anxiety
at
point
in
the
murmured
interview
he
had
looked
beyond
them
to
the
darkened
spot
where
she
sat
then
daddy
john
and
david
had
come
to
her
and
told
her
that
if
she
wished
they
would
turn
back
take
her
home
to
rochester
and
stay
there
with
her
always
there
was
money
enough
they
said
the
doctor
had
left
seven
thousand
dollars
in
his
chest
and
david
had
three
to
add
to
it
it
would
be
ample
to
live
on
till
the
men
could
set
to
work
and
earn
maintenance
for
them
no
word
was
spoken
of
her
marriage
but
it
lay
in
the
offing
of
their
argument
as
the
happy
finale
that
the
long
toil
of
the
return
journey
and
the
combination
of
resources
were
to
prelude
the
thought
of
going
back
had
never
occurred
to
her
and
shocked
her
into
abrupt
refusal
it
would
be
an
impossible
adaptation
to
outgrown
conditions
she
could
not
conjure
up
the
idea
of
herself
refitted
into
the
broken
frame
of
her
girlhood
she
told
them
she
would
go
on
there
was
nothing
now
to
go
back
for
their
only
course
was
to
keep
to
the
original
plan
emigrate
to
california
and
settle
there
they
returned
to
the
fire
and
told
courant
she
could
see
him
with
eager
gaze
listening
then
he
smiled
and
rising
to
his
feet
sent
bold
exultant
glance
through
the
darkness
to
her
she
drew
her
shawl
over
her
head
to
shut
it
out
for
she
was
afraid
they
rested
now
on
the
lip
of
the
desert
gathering
their
forces
for
the
last
lap
of
the
march
there
had
been
no
abatement
in
the
pressure
of
their
pace
and
courant
had
told
them
it
must
be
kept
up
he
had
heard
the
story
of
the
donner
party
two
years
before
and
the
first
of
september
must
see
them
across
the
sierra
in
the
evenings
he
conferred
with
daddy
john
on
these
matters
and
kept
vigilant
watch
on
the
animals
upon
whose
condition
the
success
of
the
journey
depended
david
was
not
included
in
these
consultations
both
men
now
realized
that
he
was
useless
when
it
came
to
the
rigors
of
the
trail
of
late
he
had
felt
physical
and
spiritual
impairment
that
showed
in
slighted
observance
of
his
share
of
the
labor
he
had
never
learned
to
cord
his
pack
and
day
after
day
it
turned
under
his
horse
belly
discharging
its
cargo
on
the
ground
the
men
growling
with
irritation
finally
took
the
work
from
him
not
from
any
pitying
consideration
but
to
prevent
further
delay
he
was
in
fact
coming
to
that
valley
of
desolation
where
the
body
faints
and
only
the
spirit
dauntlessness
can
keep
it
up
and
doing
what
dauntlessness
his
spirit
once
had
was
gone
he
moved
wearily
automatically
doing
his
work
and
doing
it
ill
the
very
movements
of
his
hands
slack
and
fumbling
were
an
exasperation
to
the
other
men
setting
their
strength
to
herculean
measure
and
giving
of
it
without
begrudgment
david
saw
their
anger
and
did
not
care
fatigue
made
him
indifferent
ate
into
his
pride
brought
down
his
self-respect
he
plodded
on
doggedly
the
alkali
acrid
on
his
lips
and
burning
in
his
eyeballs
thinking
of
california
not
as
the
haven
of
love
and
dreams
but
as
place
where
there
was
coolness
water
and
rest
when
in
the
dawn
he
staggered
up
to
the
call
of
catch
up
and
felt
for
the
buckle
of
his
saddle
girth
he
had
vision
of
place
under
trees
by
river
where
he
could
sleep
and
wake
and
turn
to
sleep
again
and
go
on
repeating
the
performance
all
day
with
no
one
to
shout
at
him
if
he
was
stupid
and
forgot
things
never
having
had
the
fine
physical
endowment
of
the
others
all
the
fires
of
his
being
were
dying
down
to
smoldering
ashes
his
love
for
susan
faded
if
not
from
his
heart
from
his
eyes
and
lips
she
was
as
dear
to
him
as
ever
but
now
with
devitalized
undemanding
affection
in
which
there
was
something
of
child
fretful
dependence
he
rode
beside
her
not
looking
at
her
contented
that
she
should
be
there
but
with
the
thought
of
marriage
buried
out
of
sight
under
the
weight
of
his
weariness
it
did
not
figure
at
all
in
his
mind
which
when
roused
from
apathy
reached
forward
into
the
future
to
gloat
upon
the
dream
of
sleep
she
was
grateful
for
his
silence
and
they
rode
side
by
side
detached
from
one
another
moving
in
separated
worlds
of
sensation
this
evening
he
came
across
to
where
she
sat
dragging
blanket
in
an
indolent
hand
he
dropped
it
beside
her
and
threw
himself
upon
it
with
sigh
he
was
too
empty
of
thought
to
speak
and
lay
outstretched
looking
at
the
plain
where
dusk
gathered
in
shadowless
softness
in
contrast
with
his
her
state
was
one
of
inner
tension
strained
to
the
breaking
point
torturings
of
conscience
fears
of
herself
the
unaccustomed
bitterness
of
condemnation
melted
her
and
she
was
ripe
for
confession
few
understanding
words
and
she
would
have
poured
her
trouble
out
to
him
less
in
hope
of
sympathy
than
in
craving
for
relief
the
widening
gulf
would
have
been
bridged
and
he
would
have
gained
the
closest
hold
upon
her
he
had
yet
had
but
if
she
were
more
woman
than
ever
before
dependent
asking
for
aid
he
was
less
man
wanting
himself
to
rest
on
her
and
have
his
discomforts
made
bearable
by
her
consolations
she
looked
at
him
tentatively
his
eyes
were
closed
the
lids
curiously
dark
and
fringed
with
long
lashes
like
girl
are
you
asleep
she
asked
no
he
answered
without
raising
them
only
tired
she
considered
for
moment
then
said
have
you
ever
told
lie
lie
dont
know
guess
so
everybody
tells
lies
sometime
or
other
not
little
lies
serious
ones
sinful
ones
to
people
you
love
no
never
told
that
kind
that
pretty
low-down
thing
to
do
mightnt
person
do
it
to
to
escape
from
something
they
didnt
want
something
they
suddenly
at
that
particular
moment
dreaded
and
shrank
from
why
couldnt
they
speak
out
say
they
didnt
want
to
do
it
why
did
they
have
to
lie
perhaps
they
didnt
have
time
to
think
and
didnt
want
to
hurt
the
person
who
asked
it
and
and
if
they
were
willing
to
do
the
thing
later
sometime
in
the
future
wouldnt
that
make
up
for
it
cant
tell
dont
know
enough
about
it
dont
understand
what
you
mean
he
turned
trying
to
make
himself
more
comfortable
lord
how
hard
this
ground
is
believe
it
solid
iron
underneath
he
stretched
and
curled
on
the
blanket
elongating
his
body
in
mighty
yawn
which
subsided
into
the
solaced
note
of
groan
there
that
better
ache
all
over
to-night
she
made
no
answer
looking
at
the
prospect
from
morose
brows
more
at
ease
he
returned
to
the
subject
and
asked
who
been
telling
lies
she
answered
he
gave
short
laugh
that
drew
from
her
look
of
quick
protest
he
was
lying
on
his
side
one
arm
crooked
under
his
head
his
eyes
on
her
in
languid
glance
where
incredulity
shone
through
amusement
your
father
told
me
once
you
were
the
most
truthful
woman
he
ever
known
and
agree
with
him
it
was
to
my
father
lied
she
answered
she
began
to
tremble
for
part
at
least
of
the
story
was
on
her
lips
she
clasped
her
shaking
hands
round
her
knees
and
not
looking
at
him
said
david
and
then
stopped
stifled
by
the
difficulties
and
the
longing
to
speak
david
answered
by
laughing
outright
pleasant
sound
not
guiltless
of
suggestion
of
sleep
laugh
of
good
nature
that
refuses
to
abdicate
it
brushed
her
back
into
herself
as
if
he
had
taken
her
by
the
shoulders
pushed
her
into
her
prison
and
slammed
the
door
that
all
imagination
he
said
when
some
one
we
love
dies
we
re
always
thinking
things
like
that
that
we
neglected
them
or
slighted
them
or
told
them
what
wasnt
true
they
stand
out
in
our
memories
bigger
than
all
the
good
things
we
did
dont
you
worry
about
any
lies
you
ever
told
your
father
you
ve
got
nothing
to
accuse
yourself
of
where
he
concerned
or
anybody
else
either
her
heart
that
had
throbbed
wildly
as
she
thought
to
begin
her
confession
sunk
back
to
forlorn
beat
he
noticed
her
dejected
air
and
said
comfortingly
dont
be
downhearted
missy
it
been
terribly
hard
for
you
but
you
ll
feel
better
when
we
get
to
california
and
can
live
like
christians
again
california
her
intonation
told
of
the
changed
mind
with
which
she
now
looked
forward
to
the
promised
land
his
consolatory
intentions
died
before
his
own
sense
of
grievance
at
the
toil
yet
before
them
good
lord
it
does
seem
far
farther
than
it
did
in
the
beginning
used
to
be
thinking
of
it
all
the
time
then
and
how
get
to
work
the
first
moment
we
arrived
and
now
dont
care
what
it
like
or
think
of
what
going
to
do
all
want
to
get
there
for
is
to
stop
this
eternal
traveling
and
rest
she
too
craved
rest
but
of
the
spirit
her
outlook
was
blacker
than
his
for
it
offered
none
and
drew
together
to
point
where
her
tribulations
focused
in
final
act
of
self-immolation
there
was
pause
and
he
said
drowsiness
now
plain
in
his
voice
but
we
ll
be
there
some
day
unless
we
die
on
the
road
and
then
we
can
take
it
easy
the
first
thing
going
to
do
is
to
get
mattress
to
sleep
on
no
more
blankets
on
the
ground
for
me
do
you
ever
think
what
it
ll
be
like
to
sleep
in
room
again
under
roof
good
waterproof
roof
that
the
sun
and
the
rain
cant
come
through
the
way
feel
now
that
my
idea
of
paradise
she
murmured
low
response
her
thoughts
far
from
the
flesh
pots
of
his
wearied
longing
think
just
at
this
moment
he
went
on
dreamily
rather
have
good
sleep
and
good
meal
than
anything
else
in
the
world
often
dream
of
em
and
then
daddy
john
kicking
me
and
it
morning
and
got
to
crawl
out
of
the
blanket
and
light
the
fire
dont
know
whether
feel
worse
at
that
time
or
in
the
evening
when
we
re
making
the
last
lap
for
the
camping
ground
his
voice
dropped
as
if
exhausted
before
the
memory
of
these
unendurable
moments
then
came
again
with
note
of
cheer
thank
god
courant
with
us
or
dont
believe
we
ever
get
there
she
had
no
reply
to
make
to
this
neither
spoke
for
space
and
then
she
cautiously
stole
glance
at
him
and
was
relieved
to
see
that
he
was
asleep
careful
to
be
noiseless
she
rose
took
up
tin
water
pail
and
walked
to
the
river
the
humboldt
rushed
through
deep-cut
bed
nosing
its
way
between
strewings
of
rock
up
the
banks
alders
and
willows
grew
thick
thrusting
roots
hungry
for
the
lean
deposits
of
soil
into
cracks
and
over
stony
ledges
by
the
edge
the
current
crisped
about
flat
rock
and
susan
kneeling
on
this
dipped
in
her
pail
the
water
slipped
in
in
silvery
gush
which
suddenly
seething
and
bubbling
churned
in
the
hollowed
tin
nearly
wrenching
it
from
her
she
leaned
forward
dragging
it
awkwardly
toward
her
clutching
at
an
alder
stem
with
her
free
hand
her
head
was
bent
but
she
raised
it
with
jerk
when
she
heard
courant
voice
call
wait
ll
do
it
for
you
he
was
on
the
opposite
bank
the
trees
he
had
broken
through
swishing
together
behind
him
she
lowered
her
head
without
answering
her
face
suddenly
charged
with
color
seized
by
an
overmastering
desire
to
escape
him
she
dragged
at
the
pail
which
caught
in
the
force
of
the
current
leaped
and
swayed
in
her
hand
she
took
hurried
upward
glimpse
hopeful
of
his
delayed
progress
and
saw
him
jump
from
the
bank
to
stone
in
mid-stream
his
moccasined
feet
clung
to
its
slippery
surface
and
for
moment
he
oscillated
unsteadily
then
gained
his
balance
and
laughing
looked
at
her
for
breathing
space
each
rested
motionless
she
with
strained
outstretched
arm
he
on
the
rock
film
of
water
covering
his
feet
it
was
moment
of
physical
mastery
without
conscious
thought
to
each
the
personality
of
the
other
was
so
perturbing
that
without
words
or
touch
the
heart
beats
of
both
grew
harder
and
their
glances
held
in
gaze
fixed
and
gleaming
the
woman
gained
her
self-possession
first
and
with
it
an
animal
instinct
to
fly
from
him
swiftly
through
the
bushes
but
her
flight
was
delayed
stick
whirling
in
the
current
caught
between
the
pail
rim
and
handle
and
ground
against
her
fingers
with
an
angry
cry
she
loosed
her
hold
and
the
bucket
went
careening
into
midstream
that
she
had
come
back
to
harmony
with
her
surroundings
was
attested
by
the
wail
of
chagrin
with
which
she
greeted
the
accident
it
was
the
last
pail
she
had
left
she
watched
courant
wade
into
the
water
after
it
and
forgot
to
run
in
her
anxiety
to
see
if
he
would
get
it
oh
good
came
from
her
in
gasp
as
he
caught
the
handle
but
when
he
came
splashing
back
and
set
it
on
the
rock
beside
her
it
suddenly
lost
its
importance
and
as
suddenly
she
became
prey
to
low-voiced
down-looking
discomfort
muttered
thank
you
was
all
the
words
she
had
for
him
and
she
got
to
her
feet
with
looks
directed
to
the
arrangement
of
her
skirt
he
stood
knee-high
in
the
water
watching
her
glad
of
her
down-drooped
lids
for
he
could
dwell
on
the
bloom
that
deepened
under
his
eye
you
havent
learned
the
force
of
running
water
yet
he
said
it
can
be
very
strong
sometimes
so
strong
that
little
woman
hand
like
yours
has
no
power
against
it
it
was
because
the
stick
caught
in
the
handle
she
muttered
bending
for
the
pail
it
hurt
my
fingers
you
ve
never
guessed
that
was
called
running
water
have
you
you
she
paused
with
look
arrested
in
sudden
interest
who
calls
you
that
everybody
you
eau
courante
means
running
water
doesnt
it
that
what
you
call
me
in
the
surprise
of
the
revelation
she
forgot
her
unease
and
looked
at
him
repeating
slowly
eau
courante
running
water
why
of
course
but
it
like
an
indian
name
it
is
an
indian
name
the
blackfeet
gave
it
to
me
because
they
said
could
run
so
fast
they
were
after
me
once
and
man
makes
the
best
time
he
can
then
it
was
fine
race
and
won
it
and
after
that
they
called
me
the
man
that
goes
like
running
water
the
voyageurs
and
coureurs
des
bois
put
it
into
their
lingo
and
it
stuck
but
your
real
name
she
asked
the
pail
forgotten
just
common
french
one
duchesney
napoleon
duchesney
if
you
want
to
know
both
ends
of
it
it
was
my
father
he
was
called
after
the
emperor
whom
my
grandfather
knew
years
ago
in
france
he
and
napoleon
were
students
together
in
the
military
school
at
brienne
in
the
revolution
they
confiscated
his
lands
and
he
came
out
to
louisiana
and
never
wanted
to
go
back
he
splashed
to
the
stone
and
took
up
the
bucket
she
stood
absorbed
in
the
discovery
her
child
mind
busy
over
this
new
conception
of
him
as
man
whose
birth
and
station
had
evidently
been
so
different
to
the
present
conditions
of
his
life
when
she
spoke
her
mental
attitude
was
na
vely
displayed
why
didnt
you
tell
before
he
shrugged
what
was
there
to
tell
the
mountain
men
dont
always
use
their
own
names
the
bucket
swayed
by
the
movement
threw
jet
of
water
on
her
foot
he
moved
back
from
her
and
said
like
the
indian
name
best
it
is
pretty
and
in
lower
key
as
though
trying
its
sound
she
repeated
softly
eau
courante
running
water
it
something
clear
and
strong
sometimes
shallow
and
then
again
deeper
than
you
can
guess
and
when
there
anything
in
the
way
it
gathers
all
its
strength
and
sweeps
over
it
it
mighty
force
you
have
to
be
stronger
than
it
is
and
more
cunning
too
to
stop
it
in
the
way
it
wants
to
go
above
their
heads
the
sky
glowed
in
red
bars
but
down
in
the
stream
hollow
the
dusk
had
come
cool
and
gray
she
was
suddenly
aware
of
it
noticed
the
diminished
light
and
the
thickening
purplish
tones
that
had
robbed
the
trees
and
rocks
of
color
her
warm
vitality
was
invaded
by
chill
that
crept
inward
and
touched
her
spirit
with
an
eerie
dread
she
turned
quickly
and
ran
through
the
bushes
calling
back
to
him
must
hurry
and
get
supper
they
ll
be
waiting

for
some
days
their
route
followed
the
river
then
they
would
leave
it
and
strike
due
west
making
marches
from
spring
to
spring
the
country
was
as
arid
as
the
face
of
dead
planet
save
where
the
water
course
was
marked
by
line
of
green
here
and
there
the
sage
was
broken
by
bare
spaces
where
the
alkali
cropped
out
in
white
encrusting
low
mountains
edged
up
about
the
horizon
thrusting
out
pointed
scarps
like
capes
protruding
into
slumbrous
gray-green
seas
these
capes
were
objects
upon
which
they
could
fix
their
eyes
goals
to
reach
and
pass
in
the
blank
monotony
they
offered
an
interest
something
to
strive
for
something
that
marked
an
advance
the
mountains
never
seemed
to
retreat
or
come
nearer
they
encircled
the
plain
in
crumpled
wall
the
same
day
after
day
low
girdle
of
volcanic
shapes
cleft
with
moving
shadows
the
sun
was
the
sun
of
august
it
reeled
across
sky
paled
by
its
ardor
at
midday
seeming
to
pause
and
hang
vindictive
over
the
little
caravan
under
its
fury
all
color
left
the
blanched
earth
all
shadows
shrunk
away
to
nothing
the
train
alone
as
if
in
desperate
defiance
showed
black
blot
beneath
the
wagon
an
inky
snake
sliding
over
the
ground
under
each
horse
sweating
belly
the
air
was
like
stretched
tissue
strained
to
the
limit
of
its
elasticity
in
places
parting
in
delicate
glassy
tremblings
sometimes
in
the
distance
the
mirage
hung
brilliant
blue
lake
with
waves
crisping
on
yellow
shore
they
watched
it
with
hungry
eyes
piece
of
illusion
framed
by
the
bleached
and
bitter
reality
when
evening
came
the
great
transformation
began
with
the
first
deepening
of
color
the
desert
silent
heart
began
to
beat
in
expectation
of
its
hour
of
beauty
its
bleak
detail
was
lost
in
shrouding
veils
and
fiery
reflection
the
earth
floor
became
golden
sea
from
which
the
capes
reared
themselves
in
shapes
of
bronze
and
copper
the
ring
of
mountains
in
the
east
flushed
to
the
pink
of
the
topaz
then
bending
westward
shaded
from
rosy
lilac
to
mauve
and
where
the
sunset
backed
them
darkened
to
black
as
the
hour
progressed
the
stillness
grew
more
profound
the
naked
levels
swept
out
in
wilder
glory
inundated
by
pools
of
light
lines
of
fire
eating
glowing
way
through
sinks
where
twilight
gathered
with
each
moment
it
became
more
tremendous
spectacle
the
solemnity
attendant
on
the
passage
of
miracle
held
it
from
the
sun
mouth
the
voice
of
god
seemed
calling
the
dead
land
to
life
each
night
the
travelers
gazed
upon
it
ragged
forms
gilded
by
its
radiance
awed
and
dumb
its
splendors
crushed
them
filling
them
with
nostalgic
longings
they
bore
on
with
eyes
that
were
sick
for
sight
of
some
homely
familiar
thing
that
would
tell
them
they
were
still
human
still
denizens
of
world
they
knew
the
life
into
which
they
fitted
and
had
uses
was
as
though
perished
from
the
face
of
the
earth
the
weak
man
sunk
beneath
the
burden
of
its
strangeness
its
beauty
made
no
appeal
to
him
he
felt
lost
and
dazed
in
its
iron-ringed
ruthlessness
dry
as
skeleton
by
daylight
at
night
transformed
by
witchfires
of
enchantment
the
man
and
woman
in
whom
vitality
was
strong
combatted
its
blighting
force
refused
to
be
broken
by
its
power
they
desired
with
vehemence
to
assert
themselves
to
rebel
not
to
submit
to
the
sense
of
their
nothingness
they
turned
to
one
another
hungry
for
the
life
that
now
was
only
within
themselves
they
had
passed
beyond
the
limits
of
the
accustomed
were
like
detached
particles
gone
outside
the
law
of
gravity
floating
undirected
through
spaces
where
they
were
nothing
and
had
nothing
but
their
bodies
their
passions
themselves
to
surface
observation
they
would
have
appeared
as
stolid
as
savages
but
their
nerves
were
taut
as
drawn
violin
strings
strange
self-assertions
violences
of
temper
were
under
the
skin
ready
to
break
out
at
jar
in
the
methodical
routine
had
the
train
been
larger
its
solidarity
less
complete
furious
quarrels
would
have
taken
place
with
an
acknowledged
leader
whom
they
believed
in
and
obeyed
the
chances
of
friction
were
lessened
three
of
them
could
meet
the
physical
demands
of
the
struggle
it
was
david
fate
that
unable
to
do
this
he
should
fall
to
position
of
feeble
uselessness
endurable
in
woman
but
difficult
to
put
up
with

one
morning
susan
was
waked
by
angry
voices
an
oath
shook
sleep
from
her
and
thrusting
her
head
out
of
the
wagon
where
she
now
slept
she
saw
the
three
men
standing
in

rage
on

disgust
on

john
and
on

an
abstraction
of

was

immediately
after
supper
had
fallen
asleep
he
had
evidently
been
afraid
to
tell
and
invented
the
explanation
of
dragged
picket
pins
she
did
not
know
whether
the
men
believed
it
but
she
saw
by
their
faces
they
were
in
no
mood
to
admit
extenuating
circumstances
the
oath
had
been
courant
when
he
heard
her
voice
he
shut
his
lips
on
others
but
they
welled
up
in
his
eyes
glowering
furiously
on
the
culprit
from
the
jut
of
drawn
brows
what
am
to
do
said
the
unfortunate
young
man
sending
despairing
glance
over
the
prospect
under
his
weak
misery
rebellious
ill
humor
was
visible
go
after
them
and
bring
them
back
susan
saw
the
leader
had
difficulty
in
confining
himself
to
such
brief
phrases
dragging
blanket
round
her
shoulders
she
leaned
over
the
seat
she
felt
like
woman
who
enters
quarrel
to
protect
child
couldnt
we
let
them
go
she
cried
we
ve
still
my
father
horse
david
can
ride
it
and
we
can
put
his
things
in
the
wagon
not
another
ounce
in
the
wagon
said
daddy
john
the
mules
are
doing
their
limit
now
the
wagon
was
his
kingdom
over
which
he
ruled
an
absolute
monarch
courant
looked
at
her
and
spoke
curtly
ignoring
david
we
cant
lose
horse
now
we
need
every
one
of
them
it
not
here
it
beyond
in
the
mountains
we
ve
got
to
get
over
by
the
first
of
september
and
we
want
every
animal
we
have
to
do
it
he
not
able
to
walk
he
shot
contemptuous
glance
at
david
that
in
less
bitter
times
would
have
made
the
young
man
blood
boil
but
david
was
too
far
from
his
normal
self
to
care
he
was
not
able
to
walk
and
was
glad
that
courant
understood
it
ve
got
to
go
after
them
suppose
he
said
sullenly
and
turned
to
where
the
animals
looked
on
with
expectant
eyes
but
it
the
last
time
ll
do
it
if
they
go
again
they
ll
stay
gone
there
was
mutter
from
the
other
men
susan
full
of
alarm
scrambled
into
the
back
of
the
wagon
and
pulled
on
her
clothes
when
she
emerged
david
had
the
doctor
horse
saddled
and
was
about
to
mount
his
face
heavy-eyed
and
unwashed
bore
an
expression
of
morose
anger
but
fatigue
spoke
pathetically
in
his
slow
lifeless
movements
the
droop
of
his
thin
high
shoulders
david
she
called
jumping
out
over
the
wheel
wait
he
did
not
look
at
her
or
answer
but
climbed
into
the
saddle
and
gathered
his
rein
she
ran
toward
him
crying
wait
and
have
some
breakfast
ll
get
it
for
you
he
continued
to
pay
no
attention
to
her
glancing
down
at
his
foot
as
it
felt
for
the
stirrup
she
stopped
short
repulsed
by
his
manner
watching
him
as
he
sent
forward
look
over
the
tracks
of
the
lost
horses
they
wound
into
the
distance
fading
amid
the
sweep
of
motionless
sage
it
would
be
long
search
and
the
day
was
already
hot
pity
rose
above
all
other
feelings
and
she
said
have
they
told
you
what
they
re
going
to
do
whether
we
ll
wait
here
or
go
on
and
have
you
catch
us
up
dont
know
what
they
re
going
to
do
and
dont
care
he
answered
and
touching
the
horse
with
his
spur
rode
away
between
the
brushing
bushes
she
turned
to
daddy
john
her
eyes
full
of
alarmed
question
he
knows
all
about
it
said
the
old
man
with
slow
phlegm
told
him
myself
there
food
and
water
for
him
packed
on
behind
the
saddle
done
that
too
he
have
gone
without
it
just
to
spite
himself
we
ll
rest
here
this
morning
and
if
he
aint
back
by
noon
move
on
slow
till
he
catches
us
up
dont
you
worry
he
done
the
wrong
thing
and
he
got
to
learn
no
more
was
said
about
david
and
after
breakfast
they
waited
doing
the
odd
tasks
that
accumulated
for
their
few
periods
of
rest
susan
sat
sewing
where
the
wagon
cast
cooling
slant
of
shade
daddy
john
was
beyond
her
in
the
sun
his
sere
old
body
from
which
time
had
stripped
the
flesh
leaving
only
tenuous
bark
of
muscle
was
impervious
to
the
heat
in
the
growing
glare
he
worked
over
broken
saddle
the
whitening
reaches
stretching
out
beyond
him
to
where
the
mountains
waved
in
clear
blue
line
as
if
laid
on
with
one
wash
of
saturated
paint
brush
courant
was
near
him
in
the
shadow
of
his
horse
cleaning
gun
sharp
clicks
of
metal
now
and
then
breaking
into
the
stillness
as
the
hours
passed
the
shadow
of
the
wagon
shrunk
and
the
girl
moved
with
it
till
her
back
was
pressed
against
the
wheel
she
was
making
calico
jacket
and
as
she
moved
it
the
crisp
material
emitted
low
cracklings
each
rustle
was
subdued
and
stealthy
dying
quickly
away
as
if
it
were
in
conspiracy
with
the
silence
and
did
not
want
to
disturb
it
courant
back
was
toward
her
he
had
purposely
set
his
face
away
but
he
could
hear
the
furtive
whisperings
of
the
stirred
calico
he
was
full
of
the
consciousness
of
her
and
this
sound
which
carried
picture
of
her
drooped
head
and
moving
hands
came
with
stealing
unquiet
urgently
intrusive
and
persistent
he
tried
to
hold
his
mind
on
his
work
but
his
movements
slackened
grew
intermittent
his
ear
attentive
for
the
low
rustling
that
crept
toward
him
at
intervals
like
the
effervescent
approach
of
waves
each
time
he
heard
it
the
waves
washed
deeper
to
his
inner
senses
and
stole
something
from
his
restraining
will
for
days
the
desert
had
been
stealing
from
it
too
he
knew
it
and
was
guarded
and
fearful
of
it
but
this
morning
he
forgot
to
watch
forgot
to
care
his
reason
was
drugged
by
the
sound
the
stifled
whispering
sound
that
her
hands
made
moving
the
material
from
which
she
fashioned
covering
for
her
body
he
sat
with
his
back
turned
to
her
his
hands
loose
on
the
gun
his
eyes
fixed
in
an
unseeing
stare
he
did
not
know
what
he
looked
at
or
that
the
shadow
of
the
horse
had
slipped
beyond
him
when
he
heard
her
move
his
quietness
increased
to
trancelike
suspension
of
movement
the
inner
concentration
holding
every
muscle
in
spellbound
rigidness
suddenly
she
tore
the
calico
with
keen
rending
noise
and
it
was
as
if
her
hands
had
seized
upon
and
so
torn
the
tension
that
held
him
his
fists
clinched
on
the
gun
barrel
and
for
moment
the
mountain
line
undulated
to
his
gaze
had
they
been
alone
speech
would
have
burst
from
him
but
the
presence
of
the
old
man
kept
him
silent
he
bowed
his
head
over
the
gun
making
pretense
of
giving
it
last
inspection
then
surer
of
himself
leaped
to
his
feet
and
said
gruffly
let
move
on
there
no
good
waiting
here
the
other
two
demurred
susan
rose
and
walked
into
the
glare
sweeping
the
way
david
had
gone
against
the
pale
background
she
stood
out
vital
figure
made
up
of
glowing
tints
that
reached
their
brightest
note
in
the
heated
rose
of
her
cheeks
and
lips
her
dark
head
with
its
curly
crest
of
hair
was
defined
as
if
painted
on
the
opaque
blue
of
the
sky
she
stood
motionless
only
her
eyes
moving
as
they
searched
the
distance
all
of
life
that
remained
in
the
famished
land
seemed
to
have
flowed
into
her
and
found
beautified
expression
in
the
rich
vitality
of
her
upright
form
the
flushed
bloom
of
her
face
daddy
john
bent
to
pick
up
the
saddle
and
the
mountain
man
safe
from
espial
looked
at
her
with
burning
eyes
david
not
in
sight
she
said
do
you
think
we
better
go
on
whether
we
better
or
not
we
will
he
answered
roughly
catch
up
daddy
john
they
were
accustomed
to
obeying
him
like
children
their
master
so
without
more
parley
they
pulled
up
stakes
loaded
the
wagon
and
started
as
susan
fell
back
to
her
place
at
the
rear
she
called
to
courant
we
ll
go
as
slowly
as
we
can
we
mustnt
get
too
far
ahead
david
cant
ride
hard
the
way
he
is
now
the
man
growled
an
answer
that
she
did
not
hear
and
without
looking
at
her
took
the
road
they
made
their
evening
halt
by
the
river
it
had
dwindled
to
fragile
stream
which
wandering
away
into
the
dryness
would
creep
feebly
to
its
sink
and
there
disappear
sucked
into
secret
subways
that
no
man
knew
to-morrow
they
would
start
across
the
desert
where
they
could
see
the
road
leading
straight
in
white
seam
to
the
west
david
had
not
come
the
mules
stood
stripped
of
their
harness
the
wagon
rested
with
dropped
tongue
the
mess
chest
was
open
and
pans
shone
in
mingled
fire
and
sunset
gleams
but
the
mysteries
of
the
distance
over
which
twilight
veils
were
thickening
gave
no
sign
of
him
daddy
john
built
up
the
desert
fire
as
beacon
pile
of
sage
that
burned
like
tinder
it
shot
high
tossed
exultant
flames
toward
the
dimmed
stars
and
sent
long
jets
of
light
into
the
encircling
darkness
its
wavering
radiance
red
and
dancing
touched
the
scattered
objects
of
the
camp
revealing
and
then
losing
them
as
new
flame
ran
along
the
leaves
or
charred
branches
dropped
outside
the
night
hung
deep
and
silent
susan
hovered
on
the
outskirts
of
the
glow
darkness
was
thickening
creeping
from
the
hills
that
lay
inky-edged
against
the
scarlet
of
the
sky
once
she
sent
up
high
cry
of
david
name
courant
busy
with
his
horses
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
her
scowling
over
his
shoulder
why
are
you
calling
he
said
he
can
see
the
fire
she
came
back
and
stood
near
him
her
eyes
on
him
in
uneasy
scrutiny
we
shouldnt
have
gone
on
we
should
have
waited
for
him
there
was
questioning
and
also
suggestion
of
condemnation
in
her
voice
she
was
anxious
and
her
tone
and
manner
showed
she
thought
it
his
fault
he
bent
to
loosen
girth
are
you
afraid
he
lost
he
said
his
face
against
the
horse
no
but
if
he
was
well
and
if
he
was
the
girth
was
uncinched
and
he
swept
saddle
and
blanket
to
the
ground
we
have
to
go
back
for
him
and
you
say
we
must
lose
no
time
he
kicked
the
things
aside
and
made
no
answer
then
as
he
groped
for
the
picket
pins
he
was
conscious
that
she
turned
again
with
the
nervous
movement
of
worry
and
swept
the
plain
he
was
sick
we
oughtnt
to
have
gone
on
she
repeated
and
the
note
of
blame
was
stronger
oh
wish
he
come
their
conversation
had
been
carried
on
in
low
key
suddenly
courant
wheeling
round
on
her
spoke
in
the
raised
tone
of
anger
and
am
to
stop
the
train
because
that
fool
dont
know
enough
or
care
enough
to
picket
his
horses
is
it
always
to
be
him
excuses
made
and
things
done
for
him
as
if
he
was
sick
girl
or
baby
let
him
be
lost
and
stay
lost
and
be
damned
to
him
daddy
john
looked
up
from
the
sheaf
of
newly
gathered
sage
with
the
alertness
of
scared
monkey
susan
stepped
back
feeling
suddenly
breathless
courant
made
movement
as
if
to
follow
her
then
stopped
his
face
rived
with
lines
and
red
with
rage
he
was
shaken
by
what
to
her
was
entirely
inexplicable
anger
and
in
her
amazement
she
stared
vacantly
at
him
what
that
what
that
chirped
daddy
john
scrambling
to
his
feet
and
coming
toward
them
with
chin
thrust
belligerently
forward
and
blinking
eyes
full
of
fight
neither
spoke
to
him
and
he
added
sharply
didnt
hear
swearing
who
swearing
now
as
if
he
had
his
doubts
that
it
might
be
susan
courant
with
stifled
phrase
turned
from
them
picked
up
his
hammer
and
began
driving
in
the
stakes
what
was
it
whispered
the
old
man
what
the
matter
with
him
is
he
mad
at
david
she
shook
her
head
putting
finger
on
her
lip
in
sign
of
silence
and
moving
away
to
the
other
side
of
the
fire
she
felt
the
strain
in
the
men
and
knew
it
was
her
place
to
try
and
keep
the
peace
but
sense
of
forlorn
helplessness
amid
these
warring
spirits
lay
heavily
on
her
and
she
beckoned
to
the
old
servant
wanting
him
near
her
as
one
who
no
matter
how
dire
the
circumstances
would
never
fail
her
yes
he
angry
she
said
when
they
were
out
of
earshot
suppose
it
about
david
but
what
can
we
do
we
cant
make
david
over
into
another
man
and
we
cant
leave
him
behind
just
because
he
not
as
strong
as
the
rest
of
us
feel
as
if
we
were
getting
to
be
savages
the
old
man
gave
grunt
that
had
note
of
cynical
acquiescence
then
held
up
his
hand
in
signal
for
quiet
the
thud
of
horse
hoofs
came
from
the
outside
night
with
quick
word
to
get
the
supper
ready
she
ran
forward
and
stood
in
the
farthest
rim
of
the
light
waiting
for
her
betrothed
david
was
pitiable
spectacle
the
dust
lay
thick
on
his
face
save
round
his
eyes
whence
he
had
rubbed
it
leaving
the
sockets
looking
unnaturally
sunken
and
black
his
collar
was
open
and
his
neck
rose
bare
and
roped
with
sinews
there
was
but
one
horse
at
the
end
of
the
trail
rope
as
he
slid
out
of
the
saddle
he
dropped
the
rope
on
the
ground
saying
that
the
other
animal
was
sick
he
had
left
it
dying
he
thought
he
had
found
them
miles
off
miles
and
miles
with
weak
wave
of
his
hand
toward
the
south
near
an
alkaline
spring
where
he
supposed
they
had
been
drinking
the
other
couldnt
move
this
one
he
had
dragged
along
with
him
the
men
turned
their
attention
to
the
horse
which
with
swollen
body
and
drooping
head
looked
as
if
it
might
soon
follow
its
mate
they
touched
it
and
spoke
together
brows
knit
over
the
trouble
not
paying
any
attention
to
david
who
back
in
the
flesh
was
sufficiently
accounted
for
susan
was
horrified
by
his
appearance
she
had
never
seen
him
look
so
much
haggard
stranger
to
himself
he
was
prostrate
with
fatigue
and
throughout
the
day
he
had
nursed
sense
of
bitter
injury
now
back
among
them
seeing
the
outspread
signs
of
their
rest
and
with
the
good
smell
of
their
food
in
his
nostrils
this
rose
to
the
pitch
of
hysterical
rage
ready
to
vent
itself
at
the
first
excuse
the
sight
of
the
girl
fresh-skinned
from
wash
in
the
river
instead
of
soothing
further
inflamed
him
her
glowing
well-being
seemed
bought
at
his
expense
her
words
of
concern
spoke
to
his
sick
ear
with
note
of
smug
unfeeling
complacence
david
you
re
half
dead
every
thing
ll
be
ready
in
minute
sit
down
and
rest
here
take
my
blanket
she
spread
her
blanket
for
him
but
he
stood
still
not
answering
staring
at
her
with
dull
accusing
eyes
then
with
dazed
movement
he
pushed
his
hand
over
the
crown
of
his
head
throwing
off
his
hat
the
hand
was
unsteady
and
it
fell
the
hooked
forefinger
catching
in
the
opening
of
his
shirt
dragging
it
down
and
showing
his
bony
breast
if
he
had
been
nothing
to
her
she
would
have
pitied
him
sense
of
wrongs
done
him
made
the
pity
passionate
she
went
to
him
the
consoling
woman
in
her
eyes
and
laid
her
hand
on
the
one
that
rested
on
his
chest
david
sit
down
and
rest
dont
move
again
ll
get
you
everything
never
saw
you
look
as
you
do
to-night
with
an
angry
movement
he
threw
her
hand
off
you
dont
care
he
said
what
does
it
matter
to
you
when
you
ve
been
comfortable
all
day
so
long
as
you
and
the
others
are
all
right
dont
matter
it
was
so
unlike
him
his
face
was
so
changed
and
charged
with
childish
wretchedness
that
she
felt
no
check
upon
her
sympathy
she
knew
it
was
not
david
that
spoke
but
usurping
spirit
born
of
evil
days
the
other
men
pricked
their
ears
and
listened
but
she
was
indifferent
to
their
watch
and
tried
again
to
take
his
hand
saying
pleadingly
sit
down
when
get
your
supper
you
ll
be
better
ll
have
it
ready
in
few
minutes
this
time
he
threw
her
hand
off
with
violence
his
face
under
its
dust
mask
flamed
with
the
anger
that
had
been
accumulating
through
the
day
let
me
alone
he
cried
his
voice
strangled
like
wrathful
child
dont
want
anything
to
do
with
you
eat
your
supper
when
ready
ll
get
mine
without
any
help
from
you
let
me
be
he
turned
from
her
and
moving
over
the
blanket
stumbled
on
its
folds
the
jar
was
the
breaking
touch
to
his
overwrought
nerves
he
staggered
caught
his
breath
with
hiccoughing
gasp
and
dropping
his
face
into
his
hands
burst
into
hysterical
tears
then
in
sudden
abandonment
of
misery
he
threw
himself
on
the
blanket
buried
his
head
in
his
folded
arms
and
rending
sobs
broke
from
him
for
moment
they
were
absolutely
still
staring
at
him
in
stupefied
surprise
daddy
john
his
neck
craned
round
the
blaze
surveyed
him
with
bright
sharp
eyes
of
unemotional
query
then
flopped
the
bacon
pan
on
the
embers
and
said
he
all
done
courant
advanced
step
looked
down
on
him
and
threw
sidelong
glance
at
susan
bold
with
meaning
after
her
first
moment
of
amazement
she
moved
to
david
side
drew
the
edge
of
the
blanket
over
him
touched
his
head
with
light
caress
and
turned
back
to
the
fire
the
plates
and
cups
were
lying
there
and
she
quietly
set
them
out
her
eye
now
and
then
straying
for
needed
object
her
hand
hanging
in
suspended
search
then
dropping
upon
it
and
noiselessly
putting
it
in
its
place
unconsciously
they
maintained
an
awed
silence
as
if
they
were
sitting
by
the
dead
daddy
john
turned
the
bacon
with
stealthy
care
the
scrape
of
his
knife
on
the
pan
sounding
rude
and
unseemly
intrusion
upon
this
scrupulously
maintained
quietude
the
man
weeping
broke
insistent
the
stifled
corin
why
we
are
still
handling
our
ewes

their
fells

foot
of

who
doth
he
trot
withal
rosalind
marry
he
trots
hard
with
young

between
the
contract
of
her
marriage
and
the
day
it
is
solemniz
if
the
interim
be
but
se
nnight
time
pace
is
so
hard
that
it
seems
the
length
of
seven
year
orlando
who
ambles
time
withal
rosalind
with
priest
that
lacks
latin
and
rich
man
that
hath
not
the
gout
for
the
one
sleeps
easily
because
he
cannot
study
and
the
other
lives
merrily
because
he
feels
no
pain
the
one
lacking
the
burden
of
lean
and
wasteful
learning
the
other
knowing
no
burden
of
heavy
tedious
penury
these
time
ambles
withal
orlando
who
doth
he
gallop
withal
rosalind
with
thief
to
the
gallows
for
though
he
go
as
softly
as
foot
can
fall
he
thinks
himself
too
soon
there
orlando
who
stays
it
still
withal
rosalind
with
lawyers
in
the
vacation
for
they
sleep
between
term
and
term
and
then
they
perceive
not
how
time
moves
orlando
where
dwell
you
pretty
youth
rosalind
with
this
shepherdess
my
sister
here
in
the
skirts
of
the
forest
like
fringe
upon
petticoat
orlando
are
you
native
of
this
place
rosalind
as
the
coney
that
you
see
dwell
where
she
is
kindled
orlando
your
accent
is
something
finer
than
you
could
purchase
in
so
removed
dwelling
rosalind
have
been
told
so
of
many
but
indeed
an
old
religious
uncle
of
mine
taught
me
to
speak
who
was
in
his
youth
an
inland
man
one
that
knew
courtship
too
well
for
there
he
fell
in
love
have
heard
him
read
many
lectures
against
it
and
thank
god
am
not
woman
to
be
touch
with
so
many
giddy
offences
as
he
hath
generally
tax
their
whole
sex
withal
orlando
can
you
remember
any
of
the
principal
evils
that
he
laid
to
the
charge
of
women
rosalind
there
were
none
principal
they
were
all
like
one
another
as
halfpence
are
every
one
fault
seeming
monstrous
till
his
fellow-fault
came
to
match
it
orlando
prithee
recount
some
of
them
rosalind
no
will
not
cast
away
my
physic
but
on
those
that
are
sick
there
is
man
haunts
the
forest
that
abuses
our
young
plants
with
carving
rosalind
on
their
barks
hangs
odes
upon
hawthorns
and
elegies
on
brambles
all
forsooth
deifying
the
name
of
rosalind
if
could
meet
that
fancy-monger
would
give
him
some
good
counsel
for
he
seems
to
have
the
quotidian
of
love
upon
him
orlando
am
he
that
is
so
love-shak
pray
you
tell
me
your
remedy
rosalind
there
is
none
of
my
uncle
marks
upon
you
he
taught
me
how
to
know
man
in
love
in
which
cage
of
rushes
am
sure
you
are
not
prisoner
orlando
what
were
his
marks
rosalind
lean
cheek
which
you
have
not
blue
eye
and
sunken
which
you
have
not
an
unquestionable
spirit
which
you
have
not
beard
neglected
which
you
have
not
but
pardon
you
for
that
for
simply
your
having
in

is
younger
brother
revenue
then
your
hose
should
be
ungarter
your
bonnet
unbanded
your
sleeve
unbutton
your
shoe
untied
and
every
thing
about
you
demonstrating
careless
desolation
but
you
are
no
such
man
you
are
rather
point-device
in
your
accoutrements
as
loving
yourself
than
seeming
the
lover
of
any
other
orlando
fair
youth
would
could
make
thee
believe
love
rosalind
me
believe
it
you
may
as
soon
make
her
that
you
love
believe
it
which
warrant
she
is
apter
to
do
than
to
confess
she
does
that
is
one
of
the
points
in
the
which
women
still
give
the
lie
to
their
consciences
but
in
good
sooth
are
you
he
that
hangs
the
verses
on
the
trees
wherein
rosalind
is
so
admired
orlando
swear
to
thee
youth
by
the
white
hand
of
rosalind
am
that
he
that
unfortunate
he
rosalind
but
are
you
so
much
in
love
as
your
rhymes
speak
orlando
neither
rhyme
nor
reason
can
express
how
much
rosalind
love
is
merely
madness
and
tell
you
deserves
as
well
dark
house
and
whip
as
madmen
do
and
the
reason
why
they
are
not
so
punish
and
cured
is
that
the
lunacy
is
so
ordinary
that
the
whippers
are
in
love
too
yet
profess
curing
it
by
counsel
orlando
did
you
ever
cure
any
so
rosalind
yes
one
and
in
this
manner
he
was
to
imagine
me
his
love
his
mistress
and
set
him
every
day
to
woo
me
at
which
time
would
being
but
moonish
youth
grieve
be
effeminate
changeable
longing
and
liking
proud
fantastical
apish
shallow
inconstant
full
of
tears
full
of
smiles
for
every
passion
something
and
for
no
passion
truly
anything
as
boys
and
women
are
for
the
most
part
cattle
of
this
colour
would
now
like
him
now
loathe
him
then
entertain
him
then
forswear
him
now
weep
for
him
then
spit
at
him
that
drave
my
suitor
from
his
mad
humour
of
love
to
living
humour
of
madness
which
was
to
forswear
the
full
stream
of
the
world
and
to
live
in
nook
merely
monastic
and
thus
cur
him
and
this
way
will
take
upon
me
to
wash
your
liver
as
clean
as
sound
sheep
heart
that
there
shall
not
be
one
spot
of
love
in

would
not

therefore
pray
the

it

right
many

so
is
the

more
honourable
than
the

martext
tis
no

ne
er
fantastical
knave
of
them
all
shall
flout
me
out
of
my
calling
exit
scene
iv
the
forest
enter
rosalind
and
celia
rosalind
never
talk
to
me
will
weep
celia
do
prithee
but
yet
have
the
grace
to
consider
that
tears
do
not
become
man
rosalind
but
have
not
cause
to
weep
celia
as
good
cause
as
one
would
desire
therefore
weep
rosalind
his
very
hair
is
of
the
dissembling
colour
celia
something
browner
than
judas
marry
his
kisses
are
judas
own
children
rosalind
faith
his
hair
is
of
good
colour
celia
an
excellent
colour
your
chestnut
was
ever
the
only
colour
rosalind
and
his
kissing
is
as
full
of
sanctity
as
the
touch
of
holy
bread
celia
he
hath
bought
pair
of
cast
lips
of
diana
nun
of
winter
sisterhood
kisses
not
more
religiously
the
very
ice
of
chastity
is
in
them
rosalind
but
why
did
he
swear
he
would
come
this
morning
and
comes
not
celia
nay
certainly
there
is
no
truth
in
him
rosalind
do
you
think
so
celia
yes
think
he
is
not
pick-purse
nor
horse-stealer
but
for
his
verity
in
love
do
think
him
as
concave
as
covered
goblet
or
worm-eaten
nut
rosalind
not
true
in
love
celia
yes
when
he
is
in
but
think
he
is
not
in
rosalind
you
have
heard
him
swear
downright
he
was
celia
was
is
not
is
besides
the
oath
of
lover
is
no
stronger
than
the
word
of
tapster
they
are
both
the
confirmer
of
false
reckonings
he
attends
here
in
the
forest
on
the
duke
your
father
rosalind
met
the
duke
yesterday
and
had
much
question
with
him
he
asked
me
of
what
parentage
was
told
him
of
as
good
as
he
so
he
laugh
and
let
me
go
but
what
talk
we
of
fathers
when
there
is
such
man
as
orlando
celia
that
brave
man
he
writes
brave
verses
speaks
brave
words
swears
brave
oaths
and
breaks
them
bravely
quite
traverse
athwart
the
heart
of
his
lover
as
puny
tilter
that
spurs
his
horse
but
on
one
side
breaks
his
staff
like
noble
goose
but
all
brave
that
youth
mounts
and
folly
guides
who
comes
here
enter
corin
corin
mistress
and
master
you
have
oft
enquired
after
the
shepherd
that
complain
of
love
who
you
saw
sitting
by
me
on
the
turf
praising
the
proud
disdainful
shepherdess
that
was
his
mistress
celia
well
and
what
of
him
corin
if
you
will
see
pageant
truly
play
between
the
pale
complexion
of
true
love
and
the
red
glow
of
scorn
and
proud
disdain
go
hence
little
and
shall
conduct
you
if
you
will
mark
it
rosalind
come
let
us
remove
the
sight
of
lovers
feedeth
those
in
love
bring
us
to
this
sight
and
you
shall
say
ll
prove
busy
actor
in
their
play
exeunt

another
part
of
the
forest
enter
silvius
and
phebe
silvius
sweet
phebe
do
not
scorn
me
do
not
phebe
say
that
you
love
me
not
but
say
not
so
in
bitterness
the
common
executioner
whose
heart
th
accustom
sight
of
death
makes
hard
falls
not
the
axe
upon
the
humbled
neck
but
first
begs
pardon
will
you
sterner
be
than
he
that
dies
and
lives
by
bloody
drops
enter
rosalind
celia
and
corin
at
distance
phebe
would
not
be
thy
executioner
fly
thee
for
would
not
injure
thee
thou
tell
me
there
is
murder
in
mine
eye
tis
pretty
sure
and
very
probable
that
eyes
that
are
the
frail
and
softest
things
who
shut
their
coward
gates
on
atomies
should
be
call
tyrants
butchers
murderers
now
do
frown
on
thee
with
all
my
heart
and
if
mine
eyes
can
wound
now
let
them
kill
thee
now
counterfeit
to
swoon
why
now
fall
down
or
if
thou
canst
not
for
shame
for
shame
lie
not
to
say
mine
eyes
are
murderers
now
show
the
wound
mine
eye
hath
made
in
thee
scratch
thee
but
with
pin
and
there
remains
some
scar
of
it
lean
upon
rush
the
cicatrice
and
capable
impressure
thy
palm
some
moment
keeps
but
now
mine
eyes
which
have
darted
at
thee
hurt
thee
not
nor
am
sure
there
is
not
force
in
eyes
that
can
do
hurt
silvius
dear
phebe
if
ever
as
that
ever
may
be
nearyou
meet
in
some
fresh
cheek
the
power
of
fancy
then
shall
you
know
the
wounds
invisible
that
love
keen
arrows
make
phebe
but
till
that
time
come
not
thou
near
me
and
when
that
time
comes
afflict
me
with
thy
mocks
pity
me
not
as
till
that
time

pity
thee
rosalind
advancing
and
why

old
carlot
once
was
master
of

think
not
love
him
though
ask
for
him
tis
but
peevish
boy
yet
he
talks
well
but
what
care
for
words
yet
words
do
well
when
he
that
speaks
them
pleases
those
that
hear
it
is
pretty
youth
not
very
pretty
but
sure
he
proud
and
yet
his
pride
becomes
him
he
ll
make
proper
man
the
best
thing
in
him
is
his
complexion
and
faster
than
his
tongue
did
make
offence
his
eye
did
heal
it
up
he
is
not
very
tall
yet
for
his
years
he
tall
his
leg
is
but
so-so
and
yet
tis
well
there
was
pretty
redness
in
his
lip
little
riper
and
more
lusty
red
than
that
mix
in
his
cheek
twas
just
the
difference
betwixt
the
constant
red
and
mingled
damask
there
be
some
women
silvius
had
they
mark
him
in
parcels
as
did
would
have
gone
near
to
fall
in
love
with
him
but
for
my
part
love
him
not
nor
hate
him
not
and
yet
have
more
cause
to
hate
him
than
to
love
him
for
what
had
he
to
do
to
chide
at
me
he
said
mine
eyes
were
black
and
my
hair
black
and
now
am
rememb
red
scorn
at
me
marvel
why
answer
not
again
but
that
all
one
omittance
is
no
quittance
ll
write
to
him
very
taunting
letter
and
thou
shalt
bear
it
wilt
thou
silvius
silvius
phebe
with
all
my
heart
phebe
ll
write
it
straight
the
matter
in
my
head
and
in
my
heart
will
be
bitter
with
him
and
passing
short
go

pretty
youth

me
be
better
acquainted
with
thee
rosalind
they
say
you
are
melancholy
fellow
jaques
am
so
do
love
it
better
than
laughing
rosalind
those
that
are
in
extremity
of
either
are
abominable
fellows
and
betray
themselves
to
every
modern
censure
worse
than
drunkards
jaques
why
tis
good
to
be
sad
and
say
nothing
rosalind
why
then
tis
good
to
be
post
jaques
have
neither
the
scholar
melancholy
which
is
emulation
nor
the
musician
which
is
fantastical
nor
the
courtier
which
is
proud
nor
the
soldier
which
is
ambitious
nor
the
lawyer
which
is
politic
nor
the
lady
which
is
nice
nor
the
lover
which
is
all
these
but
it
is
melancholy
of
mine
own
compounded
of
many
simples
extracted
from
many
objects
and
indeed
the
sundry
contemplation
of
my
travels
in
which
my
often
rumination
wraps
me
in
most
humorous
sadness
rosalind
traveller
by
my
faith
you

great
reason
to
be
sad
fear
you
have
sold
your
own
lands
to
see
other

then
to
have
seen
much
and
to
have
nothing

have
rich
eyes

poor
hands

experience

orlando
rosalind
and
your
experience
makes
you

travel
for
it
too

rosalind
orlando

take
occasion

very
good
orators
when

spit
and
for
lovers
lacking
god
warn
us
matter
the
cleanliest
shift
is
to
kiss
orlando
how
if
the
kiss
be
denied
rosalind
then
she
puts
you
to
entreaty
and
there
begins
new
matter
orlando
who
could
be
out
being
before
his
beloved
mistress
rosalind
marry
that
should
you
if
were
your
mistress
or
should
think
my
honesty
ranker

wit
orlando
what
of

out
of

person
die
rosalind
no

by

the
poor
world

almost
six
thousand
years
old
and
in
all
this
time
there
was
not
any
man
died
in
his
own
person
videlicet
in
love-cause
troilus
had
his
brains
dash
out
with
grecian
club
yet
he
did
what
he
could
to
die
before
and
he
is
one
of
the
patterns
of
love
leander
he
would
have
liv
many
fair
year
though
hero
had
turn
nun
if
it
had
not
been

hot
midsummer
night
for
good
youth
he

forth
to
wash
him
in
the
hellespont
and
being
taken
with
the
cramp
was
drown
and
the
foolish
chroniclers
of
that
age
found
it
was
hero
of
sestos
but
these
are
all
lies
men
have
died
from
time
to
time
and
worms
have
eaten
them
but
not
for
love
orlando
would
not
have
my
right
rosalind

kill

coming-on
disposition

orlando
take

commission
but
do
take

my
husband
there

so

more
new-fangled

when

make

the
most
unworthy

whiles

your
prayers
move
he
that

when

the
young
orlando
parted
from

he
left
promise
to
return
again
within
an
hour
and
pacing
through
the
forest
chewing
the
food
of
sweet
and
bitter
fancy
lo
what
befell
he
threw
his
eye
aside
and
mark
what
object
did
present
itself
under
an
oak
whose
boughs
were
moss
with
age
and
high
top
bald
with
dry
antiquity
wretched
ragged
man
ergrown
with
hair
lay
sleeping
on
his
back
about
his
neck
green
and
gilded
snake
had
wreath
itself
who
with
her
head
nimble
in
threats
approach
the
opening
of
his
mouth
but
suddenly
seeing
orlando
it
unlink
itself
and
with
indented
glides
did
slip
away
into
bush
under
which
bush
shade
lioness
with
udders
all
drawn
dry
lay
couching
head
on
ground
with
catlike
watch
when
that
the
sleeping
man
should
stir
for
tis
the
royal
disposition
of
that
beast
to
prey
on
nothing
that
doth
seem
as
dead
this
seen
orlando
did
approach
the
man
and
found
it
was
his
brother
his
elder
brother
celia
have
heard
him
speak
of
that
same
brother
and
he
did
render
him
the
most
unnatural
that
liv
amongst
men
oliver
and
well
he
might
so
do
for
well
know
he
was
unnatural
rosalind
but
to
orlando
did
he
leave
him
there
food
to
the
suck
and
hungry
lioness
oliver
twice
did
he
turn
his
back
and
purpos
so
but
kindness
nobler
ever
than
revenge
and
nature
stronger
than
his
just
occasion
made
him
give
battle
to
the
lioness
who
quickly
fell
before
him
in
which
hurtling
from
miserable
slumber
awak
celia
are
you
his
brother
rosalind
wast
you
he
rescu

instantly
unto
his
cave

touchstone
upon

his

was
not

well
he
was
in

word
again
it
was
not
well
cut
he
would
send
me
word
he
cut
it
to
please
himself
this
is
call
the
quip
modest
if
again
it
was
not
well
cut
he
disabled
my
judgment
this
is
call
the
reply
churlish
if
again
it
was
not
well
cut
he
would
answer
spake
not
true
this
is
call
the
reproof
valiant
if
again
it
was
not
well
cut
he
would
say
lie
this
is
call
the
countercheck
quarrelsome
and
so
to
the
lie
circumstantial

the
lie
direct
jaques
and
how
oft
did
you
say
his
beard
was
not
well
cut
touchstone
durst
go
no
further
than
the
lie
circumstantial
nor
he
durst
not
give
me
the
lie
direct
and
so
we
measur
swords
and
parted
jaques
can
you
nominate
in

now
the
degrees
of
the
lie
touchstone

the
fifth
the
countercheck
quarrelsome
the
sixth
the
lie
with
circumstance
the
seventh
the
lie
direct
all
these
you
may
avoid
but
the
lie
direct
and
you
may
avoid
that
too
with
an
if
knew
when
seven
justices
could
not
take
up
quarrel
but
when
the
parties
were
met
themselves
one
of
them
thought
but
of
an
if
as
if
you
said
so
then
said
so
and

with
her
liv
in
joy
our
wealth
increas
by
prosperous
voyages
often
made
to
epidamnum
till
my
factor
death
and
the
great
care
of
goods
at
random
left
drew
me
from
kind
embracements
of
my
spouse
from
whom
my
absence
was
not
six
months
old
before
herself
almost
at
fainting
under
the
pleasing
punishment
that
women
bear
had
made
provision
for
her
following
me
and
soon
and
safe
arrived
where
was
there
had
she
not
been
long
but
she
became
joyful
mother
of
two
goodly
sons
and
which
was
strange
the
one
so
like
the
other
as
could
not
be
disdnguish
but
by
names
that
very
hour
and
in
the
self-same
inn
mean
woman
was
delivered
of
such
burden
male
twins
both
alike
those
for
their
parents
were
exceeding
poor
bought
and
brought
up
to
attend
my
sons
my
wife
not
meanly
proud
of
two
such
boys
made
daily
motions
for
our
home
return
unwilling
agreed
alas
too
soon
we
came
aboard
league
from
epidamnum
had
we
sail
before
the
always-wind
obeying
deep
gave
any
tragic
instance
of
our
harm
but
longer
did
we
not
retain
much
hope
for
what
obscured
light
the
heavens
did
grant
did
but
convey
unto
our
fearful
minds
doubtful
warrant
of
immediate
death
which
though
myself
would
gladly
have
embrac
yet
the
incessant
weepings
of
my
wife
weeping
before
for
what
she
saw
must
come
and
piteous
plainings
of
the
pretty
babes
that
mourn
for
fashion
ignorant
what
to
fear
forc
me
to
seek
delays
for
them
and
me
and
this
it
was
for
other
means
was
none
the
sailors
sought
for
safety
by
our
boat
and
left
the
ship
then
sinking-ripe
to
us
my
wife
more
careful
for
the
latter-born
had
fast
ned
him
unto
small
spare
mast
such
as
sea-faring
men
provide
for
storms
to
him
one
of
the
other
twins
was
bound
whilst
had
been
like
heedful
of

dispos
my

on

was

fast
ned
ourselves
at

end
the
mast
and
floating
straight
obedient
to
the
stream
was
carried
towards
corinth
as
we
thought
at
length
the
sun
gazing
upon
the
earth
dispers
those
vapours
that
offended
us
and
by
the
benefit
of
his
wished
light
the
seas
wax
calm
and
we
discovered
two
ships
from
far
making
amain
to
usof
corinth
that
of
epidaurus
this
but
ere
they
came-o
let
me
say
no
more
gather
the
sequel
by
that
went
before
duke
nay
forward
old
man
do
not
break
off
so
for
we
may
pity
though
not
pardon
thee
aegeon
had
the
gods
done
so
had
not
now
worthily
term
them
merciless
to
us
for
ere
the
ships
could
meet
by
twice
five
leagues
we
were
encount
red
by
mighty
rock
which
being
violently
borne
upon
our
helpful
ship
was
splitted
in
the
midst
so
that
in
this
unjust
divorce
of
us
fortune
had
left

not
with

woe
was
carried
with
more
speed
before
the
wind
and
in
our
sight
they
three
were
taken
up
by
fishermen
of
corinth
as
we
thought
at
length
another
ship
had
seiz
on
us
and
knowing
whom
it
was
their
hap
to
save
gave
healthful
welcome
to
their
ship-wreck
guests
and
would
have
reft
the
fishers
of
their
prey
had
not
their
bark
been
very
slow
of
sail
and
therefore
homeward
did
they
bend
their
course

you

in

poor
in
that
you

have

in

with

in

brutus

this
is

now
do
you

know

you
are
censured
here
in

th

do
you

how

menenius
because
you
talk

now
will
you
not
be
angry
both
tribunes
well
well
sir
well
menenius
why
tis
no
great
matter
for
very
little
thief
of
occasion
will
rob
you
of
great
deal
of
patience
give
your
dispositions
the
reins
and
be
angry
at
your
pleasures
at
the
least
if
you
take
it
as
pleasure
to
you
in
being
so
you
blame
marcius
for
being
proud
brutus
we
do
it
not
alone
sir
menenius
know
you
can
do
very
little
alone
for
your
helps
are
many
or
else
your
actions
would
grow
wondrous
single
your
abilities
are
too
infant-like
for
doing
much
alone
you
talk
of
pride
that
you
could
turn
your
eyes
toward
the
napes
of
your
necks
and
make
but
an
interior
survey
of
your
good
selves
that
you
could
both
tribunes
what
then
sir
menenius
why
then
you
should
discover
brace
of
unmeriting
proud
violent
testy
magistrates-alias
fools
as
any
in

sicinius
menenius
you
are
known
well
enough
too
menenius
am
known
to
be
humorous
patrician
and
one
that
loves
cup
of
hot
wine
with
not
drop
of

tiber
int
said
to
be
something
imperfect
in
favouring
the
first
complaint
hasty
and
tinder-like
upon
too
trivial
motion
one
that
converses
more
with
the
buttock
of
the
night
than
with
the
forehead
of
the
morning
what
think
utter
and
spend
my
malice
in
my
breath
meeting
two
such
wealsmen
as
you
are
cannot
call
you
lycurguses
if
the
drink
you
give
me
touch
my

adversely
make
crooked

at
it
cannot

your
worships
have
deliver
the
matter
well
when
find
the
ass
in
compound
with
the
major
part
of
your
syllables
and
though
must
be
content
to
bear
with
those
that
say
you
are
reverend
grave
men
yet
they
lie
deadly
that
tell
you
you
have
good
faces
if
you
see
this
in
the

of

it
that
am

well
enough
too
what
harm
can
your
bisson
conspectuities
glean
out
of
this
character
if
be

too
brutus
come
sir
come
we
know
you
well
enough
menenius
you
know
neither
me
yourselves
nor
any
thing
you
are
ambitious
for
poor
knaves

and
legs
you
wear
out
good
wholesome
forenoon
in
hearing
cause
between
an
orange-wife
and
fosset-seller
and
then
rejourn
the
controversy
of
threepence
to

day
of

when
you
are

between
party
and
party

chance
to
be

with
the
colic
you
make

like
mummers
set
up
the
bloody

against
all

in
roaring
for
chamber-pot
dismiss
the

bleeding
the
more
entangled
by
your

all
the

you
make

our

priests
must

mockers
if

such
ridiculous
subjects

you
are
when
you

unto
the
purpose
it
is
not
worth
the

of
your

deserve
not
so
honourable
grave
as
to
stuff
botcher

or
to
be
entomb
in
an

pack-saddle
yet
you
must
be
saying
marcius
is
proud
who
in
cheap
estimation
is
worth
all
your
predecessors
since
deucalion
though
peradventure
some
of
the
best
of

were

god-den
to
your

more
of

would
infect
my

the

consul

during
his

go

sicinius
he
cannot
temp
rately
transport
his

from

will
lose
those
he
hath
won
brutus
in

comfort
sicinius
doubt
not
the
commoners
for
whom
we
stand
but
they
upon
their
ancient
malice
will
forget
with
the
least
cause
these
his
new
honours
which
that
he
will
give
them
make
as
little
question
as
he
is
proud
to
dot
brutus
heard
him
swear
were
he
to
stand
for

never
would
he
appear

market-place
nor
on

put
the
napless
vesture
of
humility
nor
showing
as
the
manner
is
his
wounds
to
th
people
beg
their
stinking
breaths
sicinius
tis
right
brutus
it
was
his
word
he
would
miss
it
rather
than
carry
it
but
by
the
suit
of
the
gentry
to
him
and
the
desire
of
the
nobles
sicinius
wish
no
better
than
have
him
hold
that
purpose
and
to
put
it
in
execution
brutus
tis
most
like
he
will
sicinius
it
shall
be
to
him
then
as
our
good
wills
sure
destruction
brutus
so
it
must
fall
out
to
him
or
our
authorities
for
an
end
we
must
suggest
the
people
in
what
hatred
he
still
hath
held
them
that
to
power
he
would
have
made
them
mules
silenc
their
pleaders
and
dispropertied
their
freedoms
holding
them
in
human
action
and
capacity
of
no
more
soul
nor
fitness
for
the
world
than
camels
in
their
war
who
have
their
provand
only
for
bearing
burdens
and
sore
blows
for
sinking
under
them
sicinius
this
as
you
say
suggested
at
some
time
when
his
soaring
insolence
shall
touch
the
people
which
time
shall
not
want
if
he
be
put
upont
and
that
as
easy
as
to
set
dogs
on
sheep
will
be
his
fire
to
kindle
their
dry
stubble
and
their
blaze
shall
darken
him
for
ever
enter
messenger
brutus
what
the
matter
messenger
you
are
sent
for
to
the
capitol
tis
thought
that
marcius
shall
be
consul
have
seen
the
dumb
men
throng
to
see
him
and
the
blind
to
hear
him
speak
matrons
flung
gloves
ladies
and
maids
their
scarfs
and
handkerchers
upon
him
as
he
pass
the
nobles
bended
as
to
jove
statue
and
the
commons
made
shower
and
thunder
with
their
caps
and
shouts
never
saw
the
like
brutus
let
to
the
capitol
and
carry
with
us
ears
and
eyes
for
th
time
but
hearts
for
the
event
sicinius
have
with
you
exeunt
scene
ii
rome
the
capitol
enter
two
officers
to
lay
cushions
as
it
were
in
the
capitol
first
officer
come
come
they
are
almost
here
how
many
stand
for
consulships
second
officer
three
they
say
but
tis
thought
of
every
one
coriolanus
will
carry
it
first
officer
that
brave
fellow
but
he
vengeance
proud
and
loves
not
the
common
people
second
officer
faith
there
have
been
many
great
men
that
have
flatter
the
people
who
ne
er
loved
them
and
there
be
many
that
they
have
loved
they
know
not
wherefore
so
that
if
they
love
they
know
not
why
they
hate
upon
no
better
ground
therefore
for
coriolanus
neither
to
care
whether
they
love
or
hate
him
manifests
the
true
knowledge
he
has
in
their
disposition
and
out
of
his
noble
carelessness
lets
them
plainly
seet
first
officer
if
he
did
not
care
whether
he
had
their
love
or
no
he
waved
indifferently
twixt
doing
them
neither
good
nor
harm
but
he
seeks
their
hate
with
greater
devotion
than
they
can
render
it
him
and
leaves
nothing
undone
that
may
fully
discover
him
their
opposite
now
to
seem
to
affect
the
malice
and
displeasure
of
the
people
is
as
bad
as
that
which
he
dislikes
to
flatter
them
for
their
love
second
officer
he
hath
deserved
worthily
of
his
country
and
his
ascent
is
not
by
such
easy
degrees
as
those
who
having
been
supple
and
courteous
to
the
people
bonneted
without
any
further
deed
to
have
them
at
all
into
their
estimation
and
report
but
he
hath
so
planted
his
honours
in
their
eyes
and
his
actions
in
their
hearts
that
for
their
tongues
to
be
silent
and
not
confess
so
much
were
kind
of
ingrateful
injury
to
report
otherwise
were
malice
that
giving
itself
the
lie
would
pluck
reproof
and
rebuke
from
every
car
that
heard
it
first
officer
no
more
of
him
he
worthy
man
make
way
they
are
coming
sennet
enter

patricians
and
the
tribunes
of
the

before
them
coriolanus
menenius
cominius
the
consul
sicinius
and
brutus
take
their
places
by
themselves
coriolanus
stands
menenius
having
determin
of
the
volsces
and
to
send
for

it
remains
as
the
main
point
of
this
our
after-meeting
to
gratify
his
noble
service
that
hath
thus
stood
for
his
country
therefore
please
you
most
reverend
and
grave
elders
to
desire
the
present
consul
and
last
general
in
our
well-found
successes
to
report
little
of
that
worthy
work
perform
by
caius
marcius
coriolanus
whom
we
met
here
both
to
thank
and
to
remember
with
honours
like
himself
coriolanus
sits
first
senator
speak
good
cominius
leave
nothing
out
for
length
and
make
us
think
rather
our
state
defective
for
requital
than
we
to
stretch
it
out
masters
th
people
we
do
request
your
kindest
ears
and
after
your
loving
motion
toward
the
common
body
to
yield
what
passes
here
sicinius
we
are
convented
upon
pleasing
treaty
and
have
hearts
inclinable
to
honour
and
advance
the
theme
of
our
assembly
brutus
which
the
rather
we
shall
be
bless
to
do
if
he
remember
kinder
value
of
the
people
than
he
hath
hereto
priz
them
at
menenius
that
off
that
off
would
you
rather
had
been
silent
please
you
to
hear
cominius
speak
brutus
most
willingly
but
yet
my
caution
was
more
pertinent
than
the
rebuke
you
give
it
menenius
he
loves
your
people
but
tie
him
not
to
be
their
bedfellow
worthy
cominius
speak
coriolanus
rises
and
offers
to
go
away
nay
keep
your
place
first
senator
sit
coriolanus
never
shame
to
hear
what
you
have
nobly
done
coriolanus
your
honours
pardon
had
rather
have
my
wounds
to
heal
again
than
hear
say

you
not
coriolanus
no
sir
yet
oft
when
blows
have
made
me

your

pray
now
sit
down
coriolanus
had
rather
have
one
scratch
my
head

sun
when
the
alarum
were
struck
than
idly
sit
to
hear
my
nothings
monster
exit
menenius
masters
of
the
people
your
multiplying
spawn
how
can
he
flatterthat
thousand
to
one
good
one
when
you
now
see
he
had
rather
venture
all
his
limbs
for
honour
than
one
on

to
hear
it
proceed
cominius
cominius
shall
lack
voice
the
deeds
of
coriolanus
should
not
be
utter
feebly
it
is
held
that
valour
is
the
chiefest
virtue
and
most
dignifies
the
haver
if
it
be
the
man
speak
of
cannot
in
the
world
be
singly
counterpois
at
sixteen
years
when
tarquin
made
head
for
rome
he
fought
beyond
the
mark
of
others
our
then
dictator
whom
with
all
praise
point
at
saw
him
fight
when
with
his
amazonian
chin
he
drove
the
bristled
lips
before
him
he
bestrid
an
erpress
roman
and
th
consul
view
slew
three
opposers
tarquin
self
he
met
and
struck
him
on
his
knee
in
that
day
feats
when
he
might
act
the
woman
in
the
scene
he
prov
best
man
th
field
and
for
his
meed
was
brow-bound
with
the
oak
his
pupil
age
man-ent
red
thus
he
waxed
like
sea
and
in
the
brunt
of
seventeen
battles
since
he
lurch
all
swords
of
the
garland
for
this
last
before
and
in
corioli
let
me
say
cannot
speak
him
home
he
stopp
the
fliers
and
by
his
rare
example
made
the
coward
turn
terror
into
sport
as
weeds
before
vessel
under
sail
so
men
obey
and
fell
below
his
stem
his
sword
death
stamp
where
it
did
mark
it
took
from
face
to

he
was
thing
of

whose
every
motion
was

with
dying
cries
alone
he
ent
red
the
mortal
gate
of
th
city
which
he
painted
with
shunless
destiny
aidless
came
off
and
with
sudden
re-enforcement
struck
corioli
like
planet
now
all
his
when
by
and
by
the
din
of
war
gan
pierce
his
ready
sense
then
straight
his
doubled

re-quick
ned
what
in

to

he
did
run
reeking
er
the
lives
of
men
as

twere
perpetual
spoil
and
till
we
call

how

sicinius
may
they
perceive
intent
he
will
require
them
as
if
he
did
contemn
what
he
requested
should
be
in
them
to
give
brutus
come
we
ll
inform
them
of
our
proceedings
here
on
th
market-place
know
they
do
attend
us
exeunt
scene
iii
rome
the
forum
enter
seven
or
eight
citizens
first
citizen
once
if
he
do
require
our
voices
we
ought
not
to
deny
him
second
citizen
we
may
sir
if
we
will
third
citizen
we
have
power
in
ourselves
to
do
it
but
it
is
power
that
we
have
no
power
to
do
for
if
he
show
us
his
wounds
and
tell
us
his
deeds
we
are
to
put
our
tongues
into
those
wounds
and
speak
for
them
so
if
he
tell
us
his
noble
deeds
we
must
also
tell
him
our
noble
acceptance
of
them
ingratitude
is
monstrous
and
for
the
multitude
to
be
ingrateful
were
to
make
monster
of
the
multitude
of
the
which
we
being
members
should
bring
ourselves
to
be
monstrous
members
first
citizen
and
to
make
us
no
better
thought
of
little
help
will
serve
for
once
we
stood
up
about
the
corn
he
himself
stuck
not
to
call
us
the
many-headed
multitude
third
citizen
we
have
been
call
so
of
many
not
that
our
heads
are
some
brown
some
black
some
abram
some
bald
but
that
our
wits
are
so
diversely
colour
and
truly
think
if
all
our
wits
were
to
issue
out
of
one
skull
they
would
fly
east
west
north
south
and
their
consent
of
one
direct
way
should
be
at
once
to
all
the
points
th
compass
second

think
you
so
which
way
do
you
judge
my
wit
would
fly
third
citizen
nay
your
wit
will
not
so
soon
out
as
another
man
will
tis
strongly
wedg
up
in
block-head
but
if
it
were
at
liberty
twould
sure
southward
second
citizen
why
that
way
third
citizen
to
lose
itself
in
fog
where
being
three
parts
melted
away
with
rotten
dews
the
fourth
would
return
for
conscience
sake
to
help
to
get
thee
wife

you
are
never
without
your
tricks
you
may
you

matter
the
greater

here
he
comes
and
in
the
gown
of
humility
mark
his
behaviour
we
are
not
to

where
he
stands
by

by
twos
and
by
threes

make
his

by

third

by

well
then

citizens
re-enter
two
other
citizens

here
the
customary

fourth
citizen
you
have
deserved
nobly
of
your
country
and
you
have
not
deserved
nobly
coriolanus
your
enigma
fourth
citizen
you
have
been
scourge
to
her
enemies
you
have
been
rod
to
her
friends
you
have
not
indeed
loved
the
common
people
coriolanus
you
should
account
me
the
more
virtuous
that
have
not
been
common
in
my
love
will
sir
flatter
my
sworn
brother
the
people
to
earn
dearer
estimation
of
them
tis
condition
they
account
gentle
and
since
the
wisdom
of
their
choice
is
rather
to
have
my
hat
than
my
heart
will
practise
the
insinuating
nod
and
be
off
to
them
most
counterfeitly
that
is
sir
will
counterfeit
the
bewitchment
of
some
popular
man
and
give
it
bountiful
to
the
desirers
therefore
beseech
you
may
be
consul
fifth
citizen
we
hope
to
find
you
our
friend
and
therefore
give
you
our
voices
heartily
fourth
citizen
you
have
received
many
wounds
for
your
country
coriolanus
will
not
seal
your
knowledge
with
showing
them
will
make
much
of
your
voices
and
so
trouble
you
no
farther
both
citizens
the
gods
give
you
joy
sir
heartily
exeunt
citizens
coriolanus
most
sweet
voices
better
it
is
to
die
better
to
starve
than
crave
the
hire
which
first
we
do
deserve
why
in
this
wolvish
toge
should
stand
here
to
beg
of
hob
and
dick
that
do
appear
their
needless
vouches
custom
calls
me
tot
what
custom
wills
in
all

should
we
dot

antique
time
would
lie
unswept
and
mountainous
error
be
too
highly
heap
for

to

rather

so
let

sicinius
fare
you
well
exeunt
coriolanus
and
menenius
he
has
it
now
and
by
his
looks
methinks
tis
warm
at

brutus
with
proud
heart
he
wore
his
humble

will
you
dismiss

how
now
my
masters
have
you
chose
this

first

he
has

sir
brutus
we
pray
the

he
may
deserve
your
loves
second
citizen
amen
sir
to
my
poor
unworthy
notice
he
mock
us
when
he
begg
our
voices
third
citizen
certainly
he
flouted
us
downright
first
citizen
no
tis
his
kind
of
speech
he
did
not
mock
us
second
citizen
not
one
amongst
us
save
yourself
but
says
he
us
us
scornfully
he
should
have
show
us
his
marks
of
merit
wounds
receiv
for
country
sicinius
why
so
he
did
am
sure
all
no
no
no
man
saw
em
third
citizen
he
said
he
had
wounds
which
he
could
show
in
private
and
with
his
hat
thus
waving
it
in
scorn
would
be
consul
says
he
aged
custom
but
by
your
voices
will
not
so
permit
me
your
voices
therefore
when
we
granted
that
here
was
thank
you
for
your
voices
thank
you
your
most
sweet
voices
now
you
have
left
your
voices
have
no
further
with
you
was
not
this
mockery
sicinius
why
either
were
you
ignorant
to
seet
or
seeing
it
of
such
childish
friendliness
to
yield
your
voices
brutus
could
you
not
have
told
himas
you
were
lesson
when
he
had
no
power
but
was
petty
servant
to
the
state
he
was
your
enemy
ever
spake
against
your
liberties
and
the
charters
that
you
bear
th
body
of
the
weal
and
now
arriving
place
of
potency
and
sway
th
state
if
he
should
still
malignantly
remain
fast
foe
to
th
plebeii
your
voices
might
be
curses
to
yourselves
you
should
have
said
that
as
his
worthy
deeds
did
claim
no
less
than
what
he
stood
for
so
his
gracious
nature
would
think
upon
you
for
your
voices
and
translate
his
malice
towards
you
into
love
standing
your
friendly
lord
sicinius
thus
to
have
said
as
you
were
fore-advis
had
touch
his
spirit
and
tried
his
inclination
from
him
pluck
either
his
gracious
promise
which
you
might
as
cause
had
call
you
up
have
held
him
to
or
else
it
would
have
gall
his
surly
nature
which
easily
endures
not
article
tying
him
to
aught
so
putting
him
to
rage
you
should
have
ta
en
th
advantage
of
his
choler
and
pass
him
unelected
brutus
did
you
perceive
he
did
solicit
you
in
free
contempt
when
he
did
need
your
loves
and
do
you
think
that
his
contempt
shall
not
be
bruising
to
you
when
he
hath
power
to
crush
why
had
your
bodies
no
heart
among
you
or
had
you
tongues
to
cry
against
the
rectorship
of
judgment
sicinius
have
you
ere
now
denied
the
asker
and
now
again
of
him
that
did
not
ask
but
mock
bestow
your
su
d-for
tongues
third
citizen
he
not
confirm
we
may
deny
him
yet
second
citizens
and
will
deny
him
ll
have
five
hundred
voices
of
that
sound
first
citizen
twice
five
hundred
and
their
friends
to
piece
em
brutus
get
you
hence
instantly
and
tell
those
friends
they
have
chose
consul
that
will
from
them
take
their
liberties
make
them
of
no
more
voice
than
dogs
that
are
as
often
beat
for
barking
as
therefore
kept
to
do
so
sicinius
let
them
assemble
and
on
safer
judgment
all
revoke
your
ignorant
election
enforce
his
pride
and
his
old
hate
unto
you
besides
forget
not
with
what
contempt
he
wore
the
humble
weed
how
in
his
suit
he
scorn
you
but
your
loves
thinking
upon
his
services
took
from
you
th
apprehension
of
his
present
portance
which
most
gibingly
ungravely
he
did
fashion
after
the
inveterate
hate
he
bears
you
brutus
lay
fault
on
us
your
tribunes
that
we
labour
no
impediment
between
but
that
you
must
cast
your
election
on
him
sicinius
say
you
chose
him
more
after
our
commandment
than
as
guided
by
your
own
true
affections
and
that
your
minds
pre-occupied
with
what
you
rather
must
do
than
what
you
should
made
you
against
the
grain
to
voice
him
consul
lay
the
fault
on
us
brutus
ay
spare
us
not
say
we
read
lectures
to
you
how
youngly
he
began
to
serve
his
country
how
long
continued
and
what
stock
he
springs
ofthe
noble
house
th
marcians
from
whence
came
that
ancus
marcius
numa
daughter
son
who
after
great
hostilius
here
was
king
of
the
same
house
publius
and
quintus
were
that
our
best
water
brought
by
conduits
hither
and
censorinus
nobly
named
so
twice
being
by
the
people
chosen

was
his
great
ancestor
sicinius
one
thus
descended
that
hath
beside
well
in
his
person
wrought
to
be
set
high
in

we
did
commend
to
your
remembrances
but
you
have
found
scaling
his
present
bearing
with
his
past
that
he
your
fixed
enemy
and
revoke
your
sudden
approbation
brutus
say
you
ne

on

still
but
by

putting

with

why

the

coriolanus
ll

more

they

the

even
when

did
not

th

we
did
request

in

they
gave

thus
we
debase

make

call

what
end
withal
this
double
worship
where
one

does
disdain
with

the
other
insult
without
all
reason
where
gentry
title
wisdom
cannot
conclude
but
by

it

you

menenius
come

something

menenius
well
said

thus
stoop
to

but
that
the

craves
it
as
physic
for

would
put
mine

on

can
scarcely
bear

what
must
do
menenius
return
to
th
tribunes
coriolanus
well
what
then
what
then
menenius
repent
what
you
have
spoke
coriolanus
for
them
cannot
do
it
to
the
gods
must
then
dot
to
them
volumnia
you
are
too
absolute
though
therein
you
can
never
be
too
noble
but
when
extremities
speak
have
heard
you
say
honour
and
policy
like
unsever
friends
th
war
do
grow
together
grant
that
and
tell
me
in

what
each
of

by

if
it
be
honour
in

to

for
your

ends
you
adopt
your
policy
how
is
it
less
or
worse
that
it
shall
hold
companionship
in
peace
with
honour
as
in
war
since
that
to
both
it
stands
in
like
request
coriolanus
why
force
you
this
volumnia
because
that
now
it
lies
you
on
to
speak
to
th
people
not
by
your
own
instruction
nor
by
th
matter
which
your

prompts
you

with
such

that
are

roted
in

though
but
bastards
and
syllables
of
no
allowance
to
your

truth
now
this
no
more
dishonours
you
at
all
than
to
take
in
town
with
gentle
words
which
else
would
put
you
to
your
fortune
and
the
hazard
of
much

as
many

both

sicinius
mark

plebeians
to

with

sicinius
peace
we
need
not
put
new
matter
to
his
charge
what
you
have
seen
him
do
and
heard
him
speak
beating
your
officers
cursing
yourselves
opposing
laws
with
strokes
and
here
defying
those
whose
great
power
must
try
him
even
this
so
criminal
and
in
such
capital
kind
deserves
th
extremest
death
brutus
but
since

what
do
you
prate
of

further
let

pronounce
the
steep
tarpeian
death
vagabond
exile
flaying
pent
to

with

would
not
buy
their

at
the
price
of

fair
word
nor
check
my
courage
for
what
they
can
give
to

with
saying
good

sicinius
for
that
he
hasas
much
as
in

lies
from

envied
against
the

seeking

to
pluck
away
their

as
now
at

given
hostile
strokes
and
that
not
in
the

on
the

the

we
ev
from

why
do
you

but
he
was
always
good
enough
for
him
second

come
we
are
fellows
and
friends
he
was
ever
too
hard
for
him
have
heard
him
say
so
himself
first
servant
he
was
too
hard
for
him
directly
to
say
the
troth
ont
before
corioli
he
scotch
him
and
notch
him
like
carbonado
second
servant
an
he
had
been
cannibally

he
might
have

first

but
more
of
thy

third

why
he
is
so
made
on
here
within
as
if
he
were
son
and
heir
to
mars
set
at
upper
end
th
table
no
question
asked
him
by
any
of
the
senators
but
they
stand
bald
before
him
our
general
himself
makes
mistress
of
him
sanctifies
himself
with
hand
and
turns
up
the
white
th
eye
to
his
discourse
but
the
bottom
of
the
news
is
our
general
is
cut
th
middle
and
but
one
half
of
what
he
was
yesterday
for
the
other
has
half
by
the
entreaty
and
grant
of
the
whole
table
he
ll
go
he
says
and
sowl
the
porter
of
rome
gates
by
th
ears
he
will
mow
all
down
before
him
and
leave
his
passage
poll
second
servant
and
he
as
like
to
dot
as
any
man
can
imagine
third
servant
dot
he
will
dot
for
look
you
sir
he
has
as
many
friends
as
enemies
which
friends
sir
as
it
were
durst
not
look
you
sir
show
themselves
as
we
term
it
his
friends
whilst
he
in
directitude
first
servant
directitude
what
that
third
servant
but
when
they
shall
see
sir
his
crest
up
again
and
the
man
in
blood
they
will
out
of
their
burrows
like
conies
after
rain
and
revel
an
with
him
first
servant
but
when
goes
this
forward
third
servant
to-morrow
to-day
presently
you
shall
have
the
drum
struck
up
this
afternoon
tis
as
it
were
parcel
of
their
feast
and
to
be
executed
ere
they
wipe
their
lips
second
servant
why
then
we
shall
have
stirring
world
again
this
peace
is
nothing
but
to
rust
iron
increase
tailors
and
breed
ballad-makers
first
servant
let
me
have
war
say
it
exceeds
peace
as
far
as
day
does
night
it
spritely
waking
audible
and
full
of
vent
peace
is
very
apoplexy
lethargy
mull
deaf
sleepy
insensible
getter
of
more
bastard
children
than
war
destroyer
of
men
second
servant
tis
so
and
as
war
in
some
sort
may
be
said
to
be
ravisher
so
it
cannot
be
denied
but
peace
is
great
maker
of
cuckolds
first
servant
ay
and
it
makes
men
hate
one
another
third

because
they

do
they

lieutenant
do
not
know
what
witchcraft
in

but
your
soldiers
use
him
as
the
grace
fore
meat
their
talk

and
their
thanks
at
end
and
you
are
dark
ned
in
this
action
sir
even
by
your
own
aufidius
cannot
help
it
now
unless
by
using
means
lame
the
foot
of
our
design
he
bears
himself
more
proudlier
even
to
my

than
thought
he
would
when
first
did
embrace
him
yet
his
nature
in
that
no
changeling
and
must
excuse
what
cannot
be
amended
lieutenant
yet
wish
siri
mean
for
your
particular
you
had
not
join
in
commission
with
him
but
either
had
borne
the
action

yourself
or
else
to

had
left
it
solely
aufidius
understand
thee
well
and
be
thou
sure
when
he
shall
come
to
his
account
he
knows
not
what
can
urge
against
him
although
it
seems
and
so
he
thinks
and
is
no
less
apparent
to
th
vulgar
eye
that
he
bears
all
things
fairly
and
shows
good
husbandry
for
the
volscian
state
fights
dragon-like
and
does
achieve
as
soon
as
draw
his
sword
yet
he
hath
left
undone
that
which
shall
break
his
neck
or
hazard
mine
whene
er
we
come
to
our
account
lieutenant
sir
beseech
you
think
you
he
ll
carry
rome
aufidius
all
places
yield
to
him
ere
he
sits
down
and
the
nobility
of
rome
are
his
the
senators
and
patricians
love
him
too
the
tribunes
are
no
soldiers
and
their
people
will
be
as
rash
in
the
repeal
as
hasty
to
expel
him
thence
think
he
ll
be
to
rome
as
is
the
osprey
to
the
fish
who
takes
it
by
sovereignty
of
nature
first
he
was
noble
servant
to
them
but
he
could
not
carry
his
honours
even
whether
twas
pride
which
out
of
daily
fortune
ever
taints
the
happy
man
whether
defect
of
judgment
to
fail
in
the
disposing
of
those
chances
which
he
was
lord
of
or
whether
nature
not
to
be
other
than
one
thing
not
moving
from
th
casque
to
th
cushion
but
commanding
peace
even
with
the
same
austerity
and
garb
as
he
controll
the

but
one
of
theseas
he
hath
spices
of
them
all
not
all
for

so
far
free
him
made
him
fear
so
hated
and
so
banish
but
he
has
merit
to
choke
it
in
the
utt

so
our

lie
in

cheap
noble
memory
cominius
minded
him
how
royal
twas
to

when
it
was

expected
he
replied
it
was
bare
petition
of

to

whom
they
had
punish
menenius
very
well
could
he
say
less
cominius
offer
to
awaken
his
regard
for
private

his
answer
to
me
was
he
could
not
stay
to
pick
them
in
pile
of
noisome
musty
chaff
he
said
twas
folly
for
one
poor

still
to

th

for

this
certain

if
thou
conquer

reap
is
such

think
thou
it
honourable
for

cares
not
for

move
him
more
than

there
no

iachimo
frenchman
dutchman
and
spaniard
iachimo
believe
it
sir
have
seen
him
in
britain
he
was
then
of
crescent
note
expected
to
prove
so
worthy
as
since
he
hath
been
allowed
the
name
of
but
could
then
have
look
on
him
without
the
help
of
admiration
though
the
catalogue
of
his
endowments
had
been
tabled
by
his
side
and
to
peruse
him
by
items
philario
you
speak
of
him
when
he
was
less
furnish
than
now
he
is
with
that
which
makes
him
both
without
and
within
frenchman
have
seen
him
in
france
we
had
very
many
there
could
behold
the
sun
with
as
firm
eyes
as
he
iachimo
this
matter
of
marrying
his
king
daughter
wherein
he
must
be
weighed
rather
by
her
value
than
his
own
words
him
doubt
not
great
deal
from
the
matter
frenchman
and
then
his
banishment
iachimo
ay
and
the
approbation
of
those
that
weep
this
lamentable
divorce
under
her
colours
are
wonderfully
to
extend
him
be
it
but
to
fortify
her
judgment
which
else
an
easy
battery
might
lay
flat
for
taking
beggar
without
less
quality
but
how
comes
it
he
is
to
sojourn
with
you
how
creeps
acquaintance
philario
his
father
and
were
soldiers
together
to
whom
have
been
often
bound
for
no
less
than
my
life
enter
posthumus
here
comes
the
briton
let
him
be
so
entertained
amongst
you
as
suits
with
gentlemen
of
your
knowing
to
stranger
of
his
quality
beseech
you
all
be
better
known
to
this
gentleman
whom
commend
to
you
as
noble
friend
of
mine
how
worthy
he
is
will
leave
to
appear
hereafter
rather
than
story
him
in
his
own
hearing
frenchman
sir
we
have
known
together
in
orleans
posthumus
since
when
have
been
debtor
to
you
for
courtesies
which
will
be
ever
to
pay
and
yet
pay
still
frenchman
sir
you
errate
my
poor
kindness
was
glad
did
atone
my
countryman
and
you
it
had
been
pity
you
should
have
been
put
together
with
so
mortal
purpose
as
then
each
bore
upon
importance
of
so
slight
and
trivial
nature
posthumus
by
your
pardon
sir
was
then
young
traveller
rather
shunn
to
go
even
with
what
heard
than
in
my
every
action
to
be
guided
by
others
experiences
but
upon
my
mended
judgment
if
offend
not
to
say
it
is
mended
my
quarrel
was
not
altogether
slight
frenchman
faith
yes
to
be
put
to
the
arbitrement
of
swords
and
by
such
two
that
would
by
all
likelihood
have
confounded
one
the
other
or
have
fall
both
iachimo
can
we
with
manners
ask
what
was
the
difference
frenchman
safely
think
twas
contention
in
public
which
may
without
contradiction
suffer
the
report
it
was
much
like
an
argument
that
fell
out
last
night
where
each
of
us
fell
in
praise
of
our
country
mistresses
this
gentleman
at
that
time
vouching
and
upon
warrant
of
bloody
affirmation
his
to
be
more
fair
virtuous
wise
chaste
constant
qualified
and
less
attemptable
than
any
the
rarest
of
our
ladies
in
france
iachimo
that
lady
is
not
now
living
or
this
gentleman
opinion
by
this
worn
out
posthumus
she
holds
her
virtue
still
and
my
mind
iachimo
you
must
not
so
far
prefer
her
fore
ours
of
italy
posthumus
being
so
far
provok
as
was
in
france
would
abate
her
nothing
though
profess
myself
her
adorer
not
her
friend
iachimo
as
fair
and
as
good
kind
of
hand-in
hand
comparisonhad
been
something
too
fair
and
too
good
for
any
lady
in
britain
if
she
went
before
others
have
seen
as
that
diamond
of
yours
outlustres
many
have
beheld
could
not
but
believe
she
excelled
many
but
have
not
seen
the
most
precious
diamond
that
is
nor
you
the
lady
posthumus
prais
her
as
rated
her
so
do
my
stone
iachimo
what
do
you
esteem
it
at

more

the

enjoys
iachimo
either
your

mistress
is
dead
or
she
outpriz
by
trifle
posthumus
you
are
mistaken
the
one
may
be
sold
or
given
if
there
were
wealth
enough
for
the
purchase
or
merit
for
the
gift
the
other
is
not
thing
for
sale
and
only
the
gift
of
the
gods
iachimo
which
the
gods
have
given
you
posthumus
which
by
their
graces
will
keep
iachimo
you
may
wear

yours

you
know
strange
fowl
light
upon
neighbouring
ponds
your

may
be
stol
too
so
your
brace
of
unprizable
estimations
the
one
is
but
frail
and
the
other
casual
cunning
thief
or
that-way
accomplish
courtier
would
hazard
the
winning
both
of
first

last
posthumus
your
italy
contains
none
so
accomplish
courtier
to
convince
the
honour
of
my

if
in
the
holding
or
loss
of
that
you
term
her
frail
do
nothing
doubt
you
have
store
of
thieves
notwithstanding
fear
not
my

leave
here
gentlemen

admittance
and
opportunity
to
friend
posthumus
no
no
iachimo
dare
thereupon
pawn
the
moiety
of
my
estate
to
your
ring
which
in
my
opinion
ervalues
it
something
but
make
my
wager
rather
against
your
confidence
than
her
reputation
and
to
bar
your
offence
herein
too
durst
attempt
it
against
any
lady
in
the
world
posthumus
you
are
great
deal
abus
in
too
bold
persuasion
and
doubt
not
you
sustain
what
are
worthy
of
by
your
attempt
iachimo
what
that
posthumus
repulse
though
your
attempt
as
you
call
it
deserve
more
punishment
too
philario

it
came

suddenly
let

iachimo
would
had
put
my

what
lady
would
you
choose
to
assail
iachimo
yours
whom
in
constancy
you
think
stands
so
safe
will
lay
you
ten

that
commend
me
to
the
court
where
your

is
with
no
more
advantage
than
the
opportunity
of
second
conference
and
will
bring
from
thence
that
honour
of
hers
which
you
imagine
so
reserv
posthumus
will
wage
against

therein
the
wiser
if
you

but
see
you

some

in

now
profess
myself
the

together
with

leaves
both
to
who
shall
find
them
iachimo
sir
my
circumstances
being
so
near
the
truth
as

first
induce
you
to

will
confirm
with

which
doubt
not
you

when
you

find
you

proceed
iachimo
first
her
bedchamber
where
confess
slept

profess
had
that
was

watching-it
was

of

she
met

piece
of

so
bravely
done
so

which
wonder
could
be
so
rarely
and
exactly
wrought
since

this
is
true
and
this
you
might
have
heard
of
here
by
me

by
some
other
iachimo
more
particulars

seen
all
this

praise
be
given

the
description
of

you

thy

this

was

why
worthy

what

we
to

that
he
swore
to

the

protects
not

then
why
should
we
be
tender
to

an
arrogant
piece
of

for
we

what
company
discover

belarius
no

can
we
set

in

he
must
have

though
his

was
nothing
but
mutation
ay
and
that
from
one
bad
thing
to
worse
not
frenzy
not
absolute
madness
could
so
far
have

to

although
perhaps
it
may
be
heard
at
court
that
such
as
we
cave
here
hunt
here
are
outlaws
and
in

may
make
some

the
which
he
hearing

might
break
out
and

not

both
empty

the

down

that
knows
why
this

why
such
daily
cast
of

such

that

at

the
whisper
goes
so
our
last
king
whose
image
even
but
now
appear
to
us
was
as
you
know
by
fortinbras
of
norway
thereto
prick
on
by
most
emulate
pride
dar
to
the
combat
in
which
our
valiant
hamlet
for
so
this
side
of
our
known
world
esteem
him
did
slay
this
fortinbras
who
by
seal
compact
well
ratified
by
law
and
heraldry
did
forfeit
with
his
life
all
those
his
lands
which
he
stood
seiz
of
to
the
conqueror
against
the
which
moiety
competent
was
gaged
by
our
king
which
had
return
to
the
inheritance
of
fortinbras

he
been
vanquisher
as
by
the

comart

carriage
of

hath
stomach
int
which
is
no
other
as
it
doth
well
appear
unto
our
state
but
to
recover
of
us
by
strong
hand
and
terms
compulsatory
those
foresaid
lands
so
by
his
father
lost
and
this
take

the
main
motive

source
of
this
our

head
of

be
no

en
so
well

it
sort
that
this
portentous
figure

armed
through

the
king
that

mightiest
julius
fell

graves

tenantless
and
the
sheeted
dead
did
squeak
and
gibber
in

roman
streets

says
polonius

hath
my

laboursome
petition
and
at
last
upon
his

how
is
it
that
the

so
my
lord
am
too
much
th

good
hamlet
cast
thy
nighted
colour
off
and
let
thine
eye
look
like
friend
on

do
not
for
ever
with
thy
vailed
lids
seek
for
thy
noble
father
in

thou
know

common
all
that

must
die
passing
through

to

no

together
with
all

shapes
of

the

the
suits
of
woe
king
tis
sweet
and
commendable
in
your
nature
hamlet
to
give
these
mourning
duties
to
your
father
but
you
must
know
your
father
lost
father
that
father
lost
lost
his
and
the
survivor
bound
in
filial
obligation
for
some
term
to
do
obsequious
sorrow
but
to
persever
in
obstinate
condolement
is
course
of
impious
stubbornness
tis
unmanly
grief
it
shows
will
most
incorrect
to

heart
unfortified
mind
impatient
an
understanding
simple
and
unschool
for
what
we
know
must
be
and
is
as
common
as
any
the
most
vulgar
thing
to
sense
why
should
we
in
our
peevish
opposition
take
it
to
heart
fie
tis
fault
to
heaven
fault
against
the
dead
fault
to
nature
to
reason
most
absurd
whose
common
theme
is
death
of
fathers
and
who
still
hath
cried
from
the
first
corse
till
he
that
died
to-day
this
must
be
so
we
pray
you
throw
to
earth
this
unprevailing
woe
and
think
of
us
as
of
father
for
let
the
world
take
note
you
are
the
most
immediate
to
our
throne
and
with
no
less
nobility
of
love
than
that
which
dearest
father
bears
his
son
do
impart
toward
you
for
your
intent
in
going
back
to
school
in

it
is
most
retrograde
to
our
desire
and
we
beseech
you
bend
you
to
remain
here
in
the
cheer
and
comfort
of
our
eye
our

courtier

two

with
solemn
march

stately
by

thrice
he
walk
by
their
oppress
and
fear-surprised
eyes
within
his
truncheon

whilst
they
distill
almost
to

with
the
act
of
fear
stand
dumb
and
speak
not
to
him
this
to
me
in
dreadful
secrecy
impart
they
did
and
with
them
the
third
night
kept
the
watch
where
as
they
had

of

where

did
you
not

hor
my
lord
did
but
answer
made
it
none
yet
once
methought
it
lifted
up
it
head
and
did
address
itself
to
motion
like
as
it
would
speak
but
even
then
the
morning
cock
crew
loud
and
at
the
sound
it
shrunk
in
haste
away
and
vanish
from
our
sight
ham
tis
very
strange
hor
as
do
live
my
honour

tis
true
and
we
did
think
it
writ
down
in
our
duty
to
let

me
hear
from
you

do
you
doubt
that
laer
for

the
trifling
of
his
favour
hold
it
fashion

toy
in

the

not
permanent
sweet
not

no

so
laer
think
it
no
more
for

crescent
does
not
grow
alone
in
thews
and
bulk
but
as
this
temple
waxes
the
inward
service
of
the
mind
and
soul
grows
wide
withal
perhaps
he
loves
you
now
and
now
no
soil
nor
cautel
doth
besmirch
the
virtue
of
his
will
but
you
must
fear
his
greatness
weigh
his
will
is
not
his
own
for
he
himself
is
subject
to
his
birth
he
may
not
as
unvalued
persons
do
carve
for
himself
for
on
his
choice
depends
the
safety
and
health
of
this
whole
state
and
therefore
must
his
choice
be
circumscrib
unto
the
voice
and
yielding
of
that
body
whereof
he
is
the
head
then
if
he
says
he
loves
you
it
fits
your
wisdom
so
far
to
believe
it
as
he
in
his
particular
act
and
place
may
give
his
saying
deed
which
is
no
further
than
the
main
voice
of
denmark
goes
withal
then
weigh
what
loss
your
honour
may
sustain
if
with
too
credent
ear
you
list
his
songs
or
lose
your
heart
or
your
chaste
treasure
open
to
his
unmast
red
importunity
fear
it
ophelia
fear
it
my
dear
sister
and
keep
you
in
the
rear
of
your
affection
out
of
the
shot

danger

the
chariest
maid

prodigal
enough

in
